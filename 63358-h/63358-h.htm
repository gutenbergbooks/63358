  <h2 class='c007'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The citizens of the United States, have sometimes been
ridiculed, for an alleged propensity to please their imaginations
with romantic visions concerning the future glory
of their country. They boast, it is said, not of what the
nation has been, nor of what it is, but of what it will be.
The American faculty, it is affirmed, is anticipation, not
memory.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the truth of this charge were admitted, it might be
replied, that the ‘proper motion’ of the youthful imagination—in
states as well as in individuals—is towards the
future. It springs forward, with buoyant wing, forgetting
the past, and disregarding the present, in the eagerness of
its desire to reach fairer scenes. It is the instinct of our
nature, the irrepressible longing of the immortal soul for
something higher and better. It is never extinguished,
though frequent disappointments abate its ardor, and long
experience confirms the testimony of revelation, that perfect
happiness is sought in vain on earth. In mature age,
therefore, reason has corrected the errors of the imagination,
and the old man looks backward to his early years,
as the happiest period of his life, and praises the men and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>the scenes of his youthful days, as far surpassing those
which he now sees around him.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Most nations are impelled, by the same principle,
to recur to some past epoch in their history, as the period
of their greatest glory. There is little in the prospect
of the future to excite their hopes. The adherents
to old institutions dread the progress of that spirit of innovation,
which has already overthrown many of them, and
which threatens speedy ruin to the rest. And the patriot,
who is striving to raise his country to the enjoyment of
liberty and happiness, foresees too many obstacles, too
much fierce strife, suffering and bloodshed, to permit him
to contemplate the future without anxiety.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is the happiness of America, that almost every thing
in her condition invites her to look forward with hope.
Her perfect freedom,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> her rapid progress, the elastic energy
of her national character, the boundless extent of her territory,
her situation, far from the contentions of European
nations, and safe from the dangers both of their friendship
and of their hostility, all awaken and justify the confident
hope, that she is destined to reach a height of prosperity
and power, which no other nation, of ancient or modern
times, has attained.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if Americans were so prone to look forward, that
they forgot the past, it would certainly be a fault, which
would deserve rebuke. Bright as the future may be, the
past can present scenes, on which the American may gaze
with pleasure, and from which he should draw lessons of
wisdom and incitements to patriotism. Passing by the
prosperous course of our history, since the adoption of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Constitution; not pausing to contemplate the formation of
that Constitution, though it was one of the most glorious
achievements of wisdom and national virtue; looking beyond
the unparalleled revolution itself; the character and
actions of the men who laid the foundations of this country
deserve the careful study, and must attract the admiration,
of every true-hearted American. The motives, the policy,
the personal qualities of the founders; their fervent piety,
their courage and patience, their unwavering constancy,
their calm wisdom, their love of learning, and their thirst
for liberty, entitle those venerable men to the affection
and gratitude of every succeeding generation. Their
faults we may now see more clearly than their contemporaries;
but those faults were, for the most part, the excesses
of their virtues, the errors of wise heads and pure
hearts, whose piety sometimes became austere, and whose
conscientious love of truth occasionally betrayed them into
intolerance. There is no stain upon their personal character;
and the American may point, with grateful pleasure,
to the bright names of Winslow, Winthrop, Hooker, Penn,
Baltimore, Oglethorpe, and their associates, as among the
choicest treasures of his country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among these names, that sense of justice, which eventually
triumphs over temporary prejudice and wrong, has
already placed that of <span class='sc'>Roger Williams</span>. Long misunderstood
and misrepresented, he was excluded from his appropriate
place among the chief founders and benefactors of
New-England. The early historians, Morton, Mather,
Hubbard, and even Winthrop, spoke harshly of his character.
His principles, both political and religious, were
offensive to the first generations; and it is not strange,
that he was viewed and treated as a fanatical heresiarch in
religion, and a factious disturber of the state.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later writers have treated his memory with more respect;
and we might quote many honorable testimonies to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>his principles and his character. But no extended memoir
of his life has ever before been published. It would not
be difficult to assign reasons for this neglect. The want
of materials, and the contradictory accounts of various
writers, were sufficient to deter his friends from the undertaking,
and a lingering prejudice against him prevented
others. The attention of some able writers has, nevertheless,
been drawn to the subject. Dr. Belknap designed to
give to the life of Roger Williams a place in his American
Biography, and he made application to several persons in
Rhode-Island for materials, but without success. It was
announced, a few years since, that Robert Southey, Esq.
intended to write the life of Mr. Williams. He probably
relinquished the plan, for the same reason. The Rev. Mr.
Greenwood, of Boston, formed the design of preparing a
memoir, at the suggestion, I believe, of Mr. Southey. Mr.
Greenwood collected many valuable materials, but the
failure of his health, and other causes, induced him to
abandon the undertaking.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>My attention was directed to the subject, in 1829, by
hearing the Rev. Dr. Sharp, of Boston, pronounce, with
his usual eloquence and true love of freedom, a eulogium
on the character of Roger Williams. I soon afterwards
suggested to him, that the life of Mr. Williams ought to be
better known. He urged me to undertake the office of
biographer, and many other friends concurred in the request.
I consented, having learned—that Mr. Greenwood
had resolved to relinquish the design. I made an application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>to him, however, to be informed of his real purposes.
With the most generous politeness, he placed at my disposal
all the materials which he had collected. Among
them were between twenty and thirty unpublished letters,
copied from the originals, which were kindly lent to him
by the Hon. Thomas L. Winthrop. These letters form a
valuable part of this volume.</p>

<p class='c009'>In my further search for information, I soon discovered,
that many persons, well acquainted with our early history,
knew very little of Roger Williams. In the books, I found
almost every important fact, concerning him, stated differently.
I was obliged to gather hints from disconnected
documents, and to reconcile contradictory assertions; and
in fine, my labor often resembled that of the miner, who
sifts large masses of sand, to obtain a few particles of gold.
I have spared neither toil nor expense to obtain materials.
I have endeavored to make the book as complete and accurate
as possible. It has cost me much time, and a
degree of labor, which no one can estimate, who has not
been engaged in similar investigations.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have, however, received much aid from several individuals.
Besides Mr. Greenwood, my thanks are especially
due to the venerable Nestor of Providence, Moses Brown,
and to John Howland, Esq. Other gentlemen are entitled
to my gratitude, whom it would give me pleasure to name.
I have, too, derived great assistance from several books.
Among these I ought to mention Mr. Backus’ History,
from which I have copied a number of valuable documents,
and gathered important information. Mr. Savage’s admirable
edition of Winthrop’s Journal has been my chief
guide, in narrating the early events of Mr. Williams’ history,
after his arrival in this country. From the valuable
Annals of Dr. Holmes, and from the Library and the Collections
of the Massachusetts Historical Society, I have
derived important aid.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>I have strongly felt the want of a history of Rhode-Island.
I have been obliged to relate many historical
facts, which I have collected, in various ways, at the
hazard of mistake and deficiency. It has been somewhat
mortifying to me, as a native of Rhode-Island, to be obliged
to rely on the writers of Massachusetts and Plymouth, for
facts concerning the history of Rhode-Island, which could
not, otherwise, be ascertained. While all the other New-England
States, and indeed most of the States of the
Union, have histories, it is hoped that Rhode-Island will
not much longer be content to bear the reproach, of being
indebted to other States for her knowledge of her own
history. I am glad to learn, that the papers of the late
Theodore Foster, Esq. are now in the possession of the
Rhode-Island Historical Society. I hope that the Society
will immediately appoint some competent person to prepare
a history of the State. The Legislature ought to aid in
procuring the requisite documents from England, and in
defraying other necessary expenses. The State has no
reason to be ashamed of her history. She owes it to herself
to record it truly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The want of such a history has induced me to insert in
this volume several documents which cannot readily be
found. I am not aware of any Rhode-Island publication,
except a file of newspapers, in which a copy of the first
charter is contained. The second charter is not easily to
be procured. Very few, probably, of the citizens possess
a copy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may, indeed, be objected to this book, that it is encumbered
with documents. But I have desired to furnish
the reader with the means of forming an acquaintance
with Mr. Williams, by a perusal of his own letters, and
other writings. These are never common-place. They
are all marked with the impress of his character. The
numerous authorities have been added, in order that if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>have committed mistakes, the reader might have the means
of correcting them. It would be strange, if, amid so much
contradiction and confusion, I have fallen into no errors.
I can only say, that I have anxiously labored to learn the
truth; and I shall be thankful for any suggestions, which
may tend to make the book more accurate and useful.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few of the notes are marked “G.” They were appended
by Mr. Greenwood to the documents which he
loaned to me, and I have taken the liberty to copy them,
as valuable illustrations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger Williams lived in an eventful period, and a memoir
of him must contain many references to contemporary
personages and events. I have endeavored, to speak of
these with candor and kindness. The character and
actions of the Pilgrim fathers have necessarily come under
review. I have been obliged, occasionally, to censure;
but it has been a source of pleasure, that the more I investigated
their actions, the more deep and sincere was my
veneration for those excellent men. It is due to them to
point out those errors in their conduct, which they, were
they now living, would lament and condemn.</p>

<p class='c009'>The position in which this country is placed, as the great
exemplar of civil and religious liberty, makes it inexpressibly
important, that the true principles on which this liberty
rests, should be thoroughly understood. A responsibility
lies on the citizens of this country, which no other nation
ever sustained. Here it is to be demonstrated, that man
can govern himself, and that religion can walk abroad in
her own dignity and unsullied loveliness, as the messenger
of God, armed with his authority, and wielding his
omnipotence; that she can speak to the hearts of men
with a voice of power, which owes no part of its emphasis
to the force of human laws; that she, instead of leaning
on the arm of the magistrate for support, can enter the
halls of legislation, the cabinets of rulers, and the courts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>of justice, to spread out her laws, and proclaim her eternal
sanctions. If civil liberty fail here, or if religion be overwhelmed
with error or worldliness, the great cause of human
happiness will suffer a disastrous check. It is believed,
that a better knowledge of the principles of Roger
Williams will have a salutary tendency, and that the
publication of a memoir of his life is opportune, at this
crisis, when, both in America and in Europe, the public
mind is strongly agitated by questions which affect both
the civil and the religious rights of men. If this book
shall contribute, in the slightest degree, to the promotion
of truth and freedom, I shall rejoice, and praise Him, who
has restored my health, and given me leisure to finish the
work.</p>

<p class='c009'>A word or two of explanation, on certain points, may
be necessary. In the quotations from old documents, I
have altered the orthography conformably to present
usage. One reason for this course was, that scarcely any
writer was consistent with himself, especially in relation to
proper names. There is, too, nothing in orthography to
mark the style of a particular writer, and it may, consequently,
be altered, without affecting the idiomatic peculiarities
of his composition, while the book is freed from
the uncouth forms of words spelled according to antiquated
fashions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Indian names have been reduced to a uniform orthography,
agreeably to what was believed to be the best
form. They are spelled, in a most perplexing variety of
ways, by different authors. Roger Williams himself sometimes
spelled the same name differently in the same document.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have endeavored to arrange the dates according to the
old style. Many mistakes have been committed, by various
authors, from a neglect of this point. Before 1752,
the year was computed to commence on the 25th of March,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>which was, accordingly, reckoned as the first month, and
January and February were the eleventh, and twelfth.
Dates between the 1st of January and the 25th of March,
are usually, in this book, marked with both years. Thus
the time of Mr. Williams’ arrival in America was the 5th
of February, 1630–1.</p>

<p class='c009'>No portrait of Roger Williams, it is believed, is in existence.
As the best substitute, a fac-simile of his hand
writing has been engraved, and prefixed to this volume.
It was copied from a document, kindly furnished by Moses
Brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ill health, and various other causes, have delayed the
work. Further search might, perhaps, detect additional
materials; but my official duties, and other reasons, forbid
a longer delay. It is now respectfully commended to the
favor of the public; and above all, to the blessing of Him,
without whose smile human approbation would be vain. I
cannot, and, indeed, ought not to, be without some solicitude
respecting the reception of a work, on which I
have expended so much time and labor, cheered by the
hope, that it would serve the cause of human happiness.
I am well aware, that it is defective in several points; but
it has not been in my power to make it more complete. I
can easily anticipate objections, which will arise in some
minds. One of these, it is probable, will be, that I have
spoken too freely of the faults of Christians and ministers;
that I have unveiled scenes of intolerance and persecution,
which the enemies of religion may view with malicious
joy. But my reply is, that I have not alluded to such topics,
except where my main theme compelled me to speak of
them. I trust, that what I have said is true, and uttered in
a respectful and kind spirit. We must not, in order to
promote or defend religion, attempt to conceal events
which history has already recorded, and much less to palliate
conduct, which we cannot justify. Let us, rather, confess,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>with frankness and humility, our own faults, and those
of our fathers; learn wisdom from past errors; and bring
ourselves and others, as speedily as possible, to the adoption
of those pure principles, by which alone Christianity can
be sustained and diffused. The book of God records,
among its salutary lessons, the mistakes and sins of good
men. I have believed, that the wrong and mischievous tendency
of intolerance could not be more forcibly exhibited,
than in the conduct of our fathers. All men concede to
them sincere piety, pure lives and conscientious uprightness
of purpose. How pernicious, then, must be a principle,
which could so bias the minds of such men, as to impel
them to oppress, banish or put to death their fellow
Christians! How dangerous the principle, if, in such
hands, its operation was so terrible! We need not wonder
that, under the direction of bigotry, ambition, cupidity and
despotism, it produced the horrors of St. Bartholomew’s,
and the atrocities of Smithfield. The experience of New-England
has proved, that the best men cannot be trusted
with power over the conscience; and that this power must
be wrested from the hands of all men, and committed to
Him who alone is competent to wield it. This volume is
dedicated to the defence of religious liberty, both by an
exposition of the principles of Roger Williams, and by a
display of the evils of intolerance. If it shall thus aid in
hastening the universal triumph of pure and undefiled religion;
my strongest desire will be accomplished.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>Early life of Mr. Williams—State of religious affairs in England—Mr.
Williams embarks for America.</p>

<p class='c008'>The obvious analogy between human life and a river
has supplied the poet with similes, and the moralist with
arguments. The resemblance of the two objects is, in this
point, at least, worthy of notice, that their origin awakens
the curiosity of every reflective mind. This feeling has
impelled many travellers to a perilous search for the sources
of the Niger and the Nile; and it made Lewis and his associates
look, with triumphant joy, on the little rill, at the
summit of the Rocky Mountains, which flows on, and expands
into the mighty Missouri.</p>

<p class='c009'>We feel a similar desire, when we survey the actions of
a distinguished individual, to learn the incidents of his
youth. The mind is perplexed and dissatisfied, if such a
personage has suddenly appeared, like Manco Capac to
the Peruvians, as if he had indeed alighted on the earth
from the sun, or risen, like the fabled Venus, from the
ocean.</p>

<p class='c009'>This curiosity has valuable uses. The instruction
which is gathered from the lives of men is drawn, in
great part, from a view of the steps, by which they advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>to their subsequent elevation in virtue and usefulness,
or to a bad eminence in crime. The character of
most men is formed early, and we can scarcely pronounce
a fair judgment respecting any individual, unless we take
into the account the circumstances, which shed a propitious
or malignant influence on those early years, when
his habits were fixed, and his principles imbibed.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a subject of regret, that of the early life of <span class='sc'>Roger
Williams</span> so little is known. A few facts only have been
preserved, and these do not rest on very certain evidence.
It is remarkable, that in his numerous writings, there are
no allusions to his parents, to the place of his birth and
education, and to other points relating to his early years.
There are, in his letters and books, but two or three incidental
references to events anterior to his arrival in this
country; though his allusions to early occurrences after
his emigration are very frequent.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was about 32 years of age when he reached our
shores; a period of life, when the energy of youth remains
without its rashness, and the mind has acquired steadiness,
without the timid caution and fixed pertinacity of old age.
It is a period, however, when the character of most men is
already formed. Though new situations and difficult
exigencies may develope unexpected powers, and give
prominence to certain traits of character, yet the mind
commonly remains unchanged in its essential qualities. It
was long since said by Horace, that those who cross the
ocean pass under a new sky, but do not acquire a new
disposition.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> This was probably true of Mr. Williams;
and if we could trace his early history, we should undoubtedly
see an exhibition of the same principles and temper
which distinguished his subsequent career.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may, however, be said of most of the prominent men
among the first settlers of New England, that their history
begins at the period of their arrival here. Our accounts
of their early lives are very brief. They were too busy to
record their own early fortunes, and too pious to feel any
pride in displaying their descent, their virtues, or their
sufferings. The present and the future filled their minds;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and they seem to have felt, that the wide ocean which separated
them from the land of their fathers had effected a
similar disjunction of their history. Of Roger Williams
less is known than of some others, because no efforts were
made by early biographers to collect facts concerning him.
His opponents were more disposed to obliterate his name,
than to record his life. His contemporary friends were
sharers in his sufferings, and were not at leisure to relate
his story or their own. Even the records of the church
which he founded at Providence contain no notice of him,
written earlier than 1775, when the Rev. John Stanford,
a venerable minister, still living in New-York, collected
the fugitive traditions concerning the origin of the church.</p>

<p class='c009'>These traditions state that Mr. Williams was born in
Wales, in 1599.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The place of his birth, and the character
of his parents, are not known. We may easily believe
that he was a native of Wales. He possessed the Welch
temperament—excitable and ardent feelings, generosity,
courage, and firmness, which sometimes, perhaps, had a
touch of obstinacy. It has been supposed, that he was a
relative of Oliver Cromwell, one of whose ancestors was
named Williams.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> This conjecture has not a very solid
basis. Roger Williams does not claim, in his writings,
any kindred to the formidable Protector, though he repeatedly
alludes to his intimacy with him, and once speaks of
a “close conference with Oliver,” on the subject of Popery,
which they both abhorred and feared. It appears, from a
remark in one of his books, that he became pious in early
life. “The truth is, from my childhood, now above threescore
years, the Father of lights and mercies touched my
soul with a love to himself, to his only begotten, the true
Lord Jesus, to his holy Scriptures,” &amp;c.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>That his parents were in humble life, and that his disposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>was pious and thoughtful, may be inferred from an
incident which is related concerning him, and which, if
true, had a great share in determining his future course.
It is said, that the famous lawyer, Sir Edward Coke, observed
him, one day, during public worship, taking notes
of the discourse. His curiosity was excited, and he requested
the boy to show him his notes. Sir Edward was
so favorably impressed by the evidences of talent which
these exhibited, that he requested the parents of young
Williams to intrust their son to his care. He placed him,
as the tradition runs, at the University of Oxford,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a> where
he drank deeply at the fountains of learning. His writings
testify, that his education was liberal, according to the taste
of those times, when logic and the classics formed the
chief objects of study at the universities.</p>

<p class='c009'>He afterwards commenced the study of the law, at the
desire and under the guidance of his generous patron, who
would naturally wish to train his pupil to the honorable
and useful profession which he himself adorned. The
providence of God may be seen in thus leading the mind
of Mr. Williams to that acquaintance with the principles of
law and government, which qualified him for his duties as
legislator of his little colony.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he probably soon found that the study of the law
was not congenial with his taste. Theology possessed
more attractions to a mind and heart like his. To this
divine science he directed his attention, and received Episcopal
orders. It is stated, that he assumed, while in England,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the charge of a parish; that his preaching was highly
esteemed, and his private character revered.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>We have thus recited the traditions which have been
current in Rhode Island. There is undoubtedly some
truth in them, though the story is a little romantic, and
may have received some embellishment in its progress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger Williams entered on public life at an eventful
period, when the national mind was strongly agitated by
those political and religious causes, which had been slowly
operating for many years, and which soon subverted the
throne and the Episcopal Church. At these causes we
can do no more than glance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Reformation, in England, commenced as far back
as the latter part of the fourteenth century, when Wickliffe
taught the pure doctrines of the Scriptures, and kindled
a great light for the guidance of the people in
the path to Heaven, by translating the Scriptures, for
the first time, into the English language. He was, of
course, denounced and persecuted by the Catholic Church,
but his doctrines spread, and though many of his followers
were put to death, and the utmost cruelty was practised,
in various ways, to hinder the progress of the truth, yet
the principles of the Reformation were extensively diffused
in England, before Luther and his fellow laborers commenced
their glorious ministry. But no public blow was
given to the papal power in England, till Henry VIII. finding
the authority of the Pope an obstacle to his favorite
project of repudiating his wife Catharine and marrying
Anne Boleyn, renounced, in 1534, his political allegiance
to his Holiness.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> The King was created, by act of Parliament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the Head of the Church, and the powers which
had previously been claimed and exercised by the Pope,
were transferred to the King. But, while the papal authority
was rejected, the doctrines of Popery were not
discarded. The King was a strenuous believer in transubstantiation,
purgatory, sprinkling of holy water, invocation
of saints, and other doctrines and rites of the Catholic
Church. He exacted as implicit a submission to his
will as the Pope himself. Indeed, little more was yet
gained, than the substitution of a Pope in England for a
Pope in Rome. Henry was of a temper too despotic to
permit him to be a friend of the Protestant religion.
To a monarch of arbitrary principles, the spirit of Popery
is more congenial than that of the Protestant faith. The
Catholic system requires an unconditional submission to
the authority of man. The first principle of Protestantism
is implicit obedience to God alone. The decisions of
Councils and the commands of the Pope bind the Catholic;
the will of God, as it is uttered in the Holy Scriptures, is
the only rule of faith and practice to the true Protestant.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the death of Henry, his son, Edward VI. ascended
the throne. He was a religious Prince, and a zealous
friend of the Reformation. The Church of England was
purified from many corruptions during his reign, a liturgy
was compiled, and the Protestant religion made a rapid
progress in the nation. But some relics of Popery were
still retained, and among others, the vestments of the
clergy. It was deemed indispensable, that the priests
should wear the square cap, the surplice, the cope, the
tippet, and other articles of apparel, which were in use
among the Popish clergy. Some excellent ministers refused
to wear these garments, on the ground that they
were associated in the public mind with Popery; were regarded
by many of the people with superstitious reverence,
and ought, consequently, to be rejected with the other corruptions
from which the church had purged herself. It
was, unquestionably, very unwise to retain an appendage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>of the old system, which tended to remind the people of
the discarded religion, to irritate the minds of its enemies,
while it nourished the attachment to it which some persons
secretly retained, and to suggest the obvious conclusion,
that as the ministers of the new religion resembled
so nearly those of the old, the difference between the two
systems was very small. The effect of wearing the popish
garments was so manifestly injurious to the progress of
truth, that the refusal to wear them was not a trivial scruple
of conscience, as it may, at first sight, appear. But
the attempt to enforce the use of them, by severe penalties,
and by expulsion from office, was unjust; and it led to a
final separation of the Protestants themselves into Conformists
and Non-Conformists.</p>

<p class='c009'>After Edward’s death, and the accession of Mary, Popery
was restored, and scenes of barbarous cruelty and bloody
persecution ensued, which have made the name of this
Queen infamous. Many hundreds of the Protestants perished
at the stake, or in prison, and multitudes fled to
Germany, Switzerland, and other countries.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reign of this fierce bigot was happily short, and
Elizabeth succeeded her. The Protestant religion was re-established,
and during her long reign it gained an ascendancy
which it has never since lost. Yet Elizabeth possessed
the despotic temper of her father. She had a fondness
for some of the gaudy rites of Popery.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> She peremptorily
insisted on the use of the clerical vestments, and on a
strict conformity to all the other ceremonies of the church.
The final separation of the Non-Conformists from the
Church of England was thus hastened. Those who had
fled from England during the reign of Mary, returned, on
the accession of Elizabeth, bringing with them an attachment
to the purer rites of the Reformed Churches in Holland,
Switzerland and France. Most of these exiles, and
of the other Non-Conformists, were, nevertheless, willing
to subscribe to the doctrines of the Church of England,
and to use the liturgy, if they might be permitted
to omit the vestments, the sign of the cross in baptism,
and some other ceremonies. They disliked the pretensions
of the Bishops, and many of them preferred the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Presbyterian or Independent form of Church government.
There were, too, some minor points in the liturgy,
to which they objected. But had they been treated with
Christian kindness, and allowed, in the spirit of mutual
forbearance and charity, to neglect those forms, which they
considered as sinful or inexpedient, they would, for the
most part, have remained in the Episcopal Church, and
England would have been spared the manifold crimes and
miseries, which issued in a civil war, and drenched her
soil with the blood of her King, and of thousands of her
bravest sons.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the principles of religious liberty were then unknown.
The Queen, though for a while she treated the
Non-Conformists with indulgence, till her power was fully
established, soon announced to them her sovereign pleasure,
that they should submit to all the ceremonies of the church.
Severe laws were passed by an obsequious Parliament, and
enforced, with ready zeal, by servile Bishops. Every minister
who refused to conform to all the prescribed ceremonies
was liable to be deprived of his office; and a large
number of the ablest ministers in the nation were thus
expelled and silenced.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> In order to enforce the laws with
the utmost rigor, a new tribunal was erected, called the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Court of High Commission, consisting of Commissioners,
appointed by the Queen. This Court was invested with
power to arrest ministers in any part of the kingdom, to
deprive them of their livings, and to fine or imprison them
at the pleasure of the Court. “Instead of producing witnesses
in open court, to prove the charges, they assumed a
power of administering an oath <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</span></i>, whereby the prisoner
was obliged to answer all questions the Court should
put to him, though never so prejudicial to his own defence.
If he refused to swear, he was imprisoned for contempt;
and if he took the oath, he was convicted upon his own
confession.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a> By this Protestant Inquisition, and by other
means, one fourth of the preachers in England are said to
have been under suspension. Numerous parishes were
destitute of preachers, and so many were filled by illiterate
and profligate men, that not one beneficed clergyman in
six was capable of composing a sermon.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Thus were
learned and pious ministers oppressed, merely for their conscientious
scruples about a few ceremonies, their families
were ruined, the people were deprived of faithful teachers,
the progress of truth was hindered, the papists were gratified,
and a state of irritation was produced in the public
mind, which led, in a succeeding reign, to the disastrous
issue of a bloody civil war.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor was the edge of this intolerance turned against the
clergy alone. The people were rigorously required to attend
regularly at the parish churches.</p>

<p class='c009'>Measures like these gradually alienated the affections of
many from the Established Church, and convinced them,
that there was no prospect of obtaining toleration, or of
effecting a further reform in the church. They accordingly
separated from it, and established meetings, where the ceremonies
were not practised. These Non-Conformists were
called Puritans, a term of reproach derived from the Cathari,
or Puritans, of the third century after Christ. The
term, however, was not inappropriate, as it intimated their
desire of a purer form of worship and discipline in the
church. It was afterwards applied to them on account of
the purity of their morals, and the Calvinistic cast of their
doctrines.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>This separation occurred in the year 1566. The storm
of royal and ecclesiastical wrath now beat the more fiercely
on the heads of the Puritans. The history of England, for
the succeeding century, is a deplorable narrative of oppression,
bloodshed and indescribable misery, inflicted on men
and women, of deep piety and pure lives, but guilty of
claiming the rights of conscience, and choosing to worship
God with different forms from those which the National
Church prescribed. No man, of right feelings, can read
Neal’s History of the Puritans, without sorrow and indignation.
Every man ought to read it, if he would understand
the reasons why the founders of this country left their native
land, to seek an asylum in the wilderness, and if he
would rightly estimate the great principles of religious liberty
which Roger Williams maintained and defended.</p>

<p class='c009'>The accession of James I. excited the hopes of the Puritans.
He had been educated in the principles of the Reformation,
and had stigmatized the service of the Church
of England as “an evil said mass in English.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a> He had
promised, that he would maintain the principles of the
Church of Scotland while he lived. But he changed his
principles or his policy, after he ascended the throne of
England. He then announced the true royal creed, <em>No
Bishops, no King</em>. He treated the Puritans with contempt
and rigor, declaring that they were a sect “unable to be
suffered in any well-governed commonwealth.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Many of
the Puritans, finding their situation intolerable at home,
left the kingdom for the continent, or turned their eyes to
America for a refuge from persecution.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the midst of these scenes, Roger Williams was born
and educated. His character impelled him to the side of
the Puritans. His political principles were then, it is
probable, as they were throughout his subsequent life, very
liberal; and were entirely repugnant to the doctrines
which were then upheld by the court and the dignitaries
of the church. James was an obstinate and arbitrary
monarch, who inflexibly maintained, in theory and often in
practice, those despotic principles, which led his son to the
scaffold, and expelled James II. from the throne. A mind,
like that of Williams, strong, searching and fearless, would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>naturally be opposed to the pretensions and policy of the
King.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> His patron, Sir Edward Coke, incurred the resentment
of James, for his free principles, and his bold vindication
of the rights of the people. Charles I. was, if
possible, more arbitrary than his father, and more disposed
to trample on the constitution, and on the rights of the
people.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tyranny exercised by the Bishops, the severe persecution
of the Puritans, and the arrogant demand of absolute
submission to the National Church, were still more
offensive to a man like Mr. Williams. His principles, as
he afterwards expounded them, by his life and in his writings,
claimed for all men a perfect liberty of conscience, in
reference to religion. Such principles, allied to a bold
spirit, must have brought him into notice at such a crisis,
and must have attracted upon his head the storm of persecution.
Cotton, Hooker, and many other ministers, were
silenced. In such times, Mr. Williams could not escape.
If he was indeed admitted to a living, it must have been
through the indulgence of some mild Prelate, or by the influence
of some powerful patron. If Cotton and Hooker
were not spared, Williams could not be suffered to preach,
for his refusal to conform seems to have been more decided
than theirs.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The same motives, without doubt, which induced others
to forsake their native land for America, operated on the
mind of Mr. Williams. On the 1st of December, 1630,
he embarked at Bristol, in the ship Lyon, Captain William
Peirce. His wife accompanied him, a lady, of whose previous
history we are more ignorant than of his own.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>There is, however, satisfactory evidence, in her subsequent
life, of her virtues as a wife and a mother. We cannot
doubt, that she was of a kindred spirit with her husband,
whose fortunes, both adverse and prosperous, she shared
for half a century.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Historical Sketch—View of the condition of the country at the time
of Mr. Williams’ arrival.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first settlement, by Europeans, in North America,
was made in 1585, when Sir Walter Raleigh sent a fleet
of seven ships from England to Virginia. One hundred
and seven persons were landed on the island of Roanoke,
near the mouth of Albemarle Sound, in the present State
of North Carolina. But discouraged by the want of provisions,
and probably by other causes, all the colonists returned
to England the next year. Another, and more successful,
attempt was made twenty years afterwards, under
the authority of a patent from King James, who granted all
the territory in North America, comprehended between
the 34th and 45th degrees of latitude, to be equally divided
between two companies, called, respectively, the London
and the Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1607, three ships, with one hundred emigrants, formed
a settlement on the James River, in Virginia, and called
the spot Jamestown, in honor of the King.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the same year, a small colony made a settlement at
the mouth of the Kennebec River, in the present State of
Maine; but the loss of their stores by fire, and the severity
of the winter, induced them all to abandon the undertaking
the next year, and return to England.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1610, a settlement was commenced at Newfoundland,
and in 1614, the Dutch built a fort on the island of Manhattan,
where the city of New York now stands, and held
the country many years, under a grant from the States’
General, by the name of the New Netherlands.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In 1620, the ever memorable landing of the Pilgrims at
Plymouth took place. The colonists were a company of
Puritans, who left England so early as 1608, with their
pastor, the Rev. John Robinson, and settled at Leyden, in
Holland. The merciless oppression which they endured
in England impelled them thus to abandon their native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>land. They enjoyed protection and prosperity in Holland,
but they were not satisfied with their condition and prospects
in that country, which a foreign language and lax
morals rendered an undesirable home for them and their
children. They accordingly resolved to emigrate to America.
They sailed from Plymouth (England) in September,
1620, and on the 11th of December they landed at the
spot to which they gave the name of Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The settlement of Massachusetts Bay occurred a few
years after. This great enterprise was conducted under
the direction of the Plymouth Company, who obtained a
new patent from King James, by which a number of the
highest nobility and gentry of England, their associates
and successors, were constituted “the Council established
at Plymouth, in the county of Devon, for the planting,
ruling, ordering and governing of New England, in America.”
By this patent, the whole territory between the 40th
and the 48th degrees of north latitude, from the Atlantic
to the Pacific Ocean, was granted to the company.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a> In
1627–8, the Company sold to several gentlemen, among
whom were John Endicott and John Humfrey, all that part
of New-England which lies between three miles north of
Merrimac River and three miles south of Charles River,
across the whole breadth of the continent. In June, 1628,
Mr. Endicott sailed from England, for Naumkeag, since
called Salem, where a small company of emigrants had
fixed their residence a short time before. Mr. Endicott’s
first letter from America is dated September 13, 1628, and
his arrival is considered as the date of the first permanent
settlement of Massachusetts Proper.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The patent from the Council of Plymouth gave a good
right to the soil, (says Hutchinson, vol. i. pp. 16, 17) but
no powers of government. A royal charter was necessary.
This passed the seals March 4, 1628–9. It confirmed the
patent of the Council of Plymouth, and created the Governor
and Company of the Massachusetts Bay, in New-England,
a body politic and corporate. By this charter,
the Company were empowered to elect, annually, forever,
out of the freemen of said Company, a Governor, a Deputy
Governor, and eighteen assistants, and to make laws not
repugnant to the laws of England.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the state of things in the parent country daily became
more distressing to the friends of religion and liberty,
an emigration, unparalleled for its extent, and for the
character of the emigrants, was projected. A considerable
number of persons of great respectability, of good fortune,
and of consideration in society, among whom were
Winthrop, Dudley, Johnson, and Saltonstall, resolved to
remove, with their families and property, to Massachusetts,
on condition that the charter of the colony and the seat of
its government should be transferred to America. This important
proposition was acceded to, and on the 28th of
April, 1630, Winthrop, who had been elected Governor,
and his associates, sailed from Yarmouth,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> in a fleet,
which, with the vessels that preceded and followed them
the same season, amounted in the whole to seventeen sail,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
with above fifteen hundred passengers.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a> The Arbella,
with Governor Winthrop on board, arrived at Salem on the
12th of June, and the other vessels arrived soon after.
The colonists there had lost eighty of their number by
death the winter previous. Their provisions were nearly
consumed, and they were in a distressing situation. The
arrival of the new emigrants occasioned great joy to the
sufferers, and revived their hopes.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was early determined that Salem was not the proper
position for the capital. The Governor, and the principal
part of the emigrants, left Salem soon after their arrival,
and resided awhile at Charlestown. Here sickness prevailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>among them, and a considerable number died.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
They were distressed by the want of fresh water. Many of
them accordingly abandoned Charlestown, and settled at
Watertown and Dorchester, while a still larger number removed,
in September, to the other side of the river, and
laid the foundation of Boston. The peninsula was then
inhabited by only one white man, the Rev. William Blackstone.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
It was called by the Indians Shawmut, and by
the neighboring settlers, Trimountain, the former name
signifying the abundance and sweetness of its waters, the
latter the peculiar character of its hills.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a> It was called
Boston by a vote of the Court, September 7, in well deserved
honor of the Rev. John Cotton, who had been a
minister of Boston, in England, and whose arrival in
America was earnestly expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sufferings of the first inhabitants of the metropolis
were very great. Sickness swept many of them into the
grave. The weather during the winter was extremely severe,
and provisions were so scarce, that the inhabitants
were in imminent peril of starvation.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a> At this critical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>juncture, the ship Lyon, in which Roger Williams had
embarked, arrived, on the 5th of February, 1630–1. Governor
Winthrop (vol. i. pp. 41, 42) thus records the arrival
of this vessel:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Feb. 5. The ship Lyon,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Mr. William Peirce, master,
arrived at Nantasket. She brought Mr. Williams, a godly
minister,<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a> with his wife, Mr. Throgmorton, Perkins, Ong,
and others, with their wives and children, about twenty
passengers, and about two hundred tons of goods. She set
sail from Bristol, December 1. She had a very tempestuous
passage, yet through God’s mercy, all her people came
safe, except Way his son, who fell from the spritsail yard
in a tempest, and could not be recovered, though he kept
in sight near a quarter of an hour; her goods also came all
in good condition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The strong contrast between the situation of the present
inhabitants of the metropolis, and that of the little company
of suffering exiles in 1630, forces itself on our minds.
They were few in number. They had no suitable dwellings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to shelter them from the rigors of winter, then more
severe, perhaps, than any which we now experience. They
were almost without food. Disease was among them, and
several of their number sunk into the grave, whose lives
might doubtless have been preserved, had they been furnished
with suitable shelter, food and medicine. When
they looked around them, all was dreary and melancholy.
“Where now exists a dense and aggregated mass of living
beings and material things, amid all the accommodations
of life, the splendors of wealth, the delights of taste, and
whatever can gratify the cultivated intellect, there were
then only a few hills, which, when the ocean receded,
were intersected by wide marshes, and when its tide returned,
appeared a group of lofty islands, abruptly rising
from the surrounding waters. Thick forests concealed
the neighboring hills, and the deep silence of nature was
broken only by the voice of the wild beast or the bird, and
the war whoop of the savage.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>How different the situation of the present inhabitants.
That little company has swelled to more than sixty thousand.
Those forests, which then covered the hills and vallies,
are gone; the ocean has been driven back from much
of the space over which it then rolled; and now, where
stood the few tents and cabins of the first settlers, have
sprung up, over the whole peninsula, sumptuous structures
and spacious temples, comfortable dwellings, ample warehouses,
and every thing which can minister to the happiness
of men. The poorest of its citizens is better sheltered
and better fed, than some of the richest families among the
first inhabitants. Let them give devout thanks to God,
that He has reserved for them a happier lot than that of
their fathers. Let them, amid their profusion of blessings,
praise the Lord, who has done so great things for their
city, and its successive generations. Let them, above all,
hold fast those great truths, for which the founders sacrificed
every thing dear to them on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the colonists came to this country to enjoy the privilege
of worshipping God according to their conceptions of
His will, it was, of course, among their first objects to form
churches, and make provision for the regular worship of
the Most High.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>The settlers at Plymouth were organized as a church
before they left Holland, and as such they landed on our
shores. This church was formed on the principle of entire
independence on all human authority. Its members
belonged to that class of the Non-Conformists, who had
separated entirely from the Church of England, and adopted
a form of church polity which they deemed more consistent
with the letter and the spirit of the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c009'>The separate independence of each church on all others;
the necessity of true piety as a qualification for membership;
the right of each church to elect its own officers;
the rejection of all officers except pastors or elders, and
deacons, and the entire equality of all pastors and elders,
in respect to power and privileges, were among the principles
adopted by this excellent body of Christians. They
are the principles which the Scriptures teach, and it would
have been happy for the cause of truth, if they had been
held fast, without any corrupt mixture, by all the churches
which professed to receive them. Another principle adopted
by the church of Plymouth was, that ecclesiastical censures
are wholly spiritual, and not to be accompanied with
temporal penalties. In this respect, the church of Plymouth
were in advance of their brethren in Massachusetts,
and the history of the Plymouth colony is honorably distinguished
by a tolerant spirit, which contributed not less to
her peace and prosperity, than to her true fame.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first settlers at Salem, Boston, and other towns in
Massachusetts Bay, belonged, for the most part, to the
other class of Non-Conformists, who did not, while in
England, separate wholly from the Established Church,
though they opposed her corruptions. They desired only a
further reform of the Church herself, and retained their
membership, some of them conforming, though reluctantly,
to her ceremonies, to avoid persecution, and others refusing
such a conformity, protected awhile by the indulgence of
some mild Prelates, or by the friendship of powerful laymen.
When, at length, despairing of the desired reform,
and weary of persecution, they embarked for America,
they came as members of the Church of England. Winthrop
and his associates, while on board the fleet at Yarmouth,
addressed a farewell letter to the “rest of their
brethren in and of the Church of England,” which is as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>beautiful in diction as it is admirable for its affectionate
pathos. They say, “We desire you would be pleased to
take notice of the principals and body of our company, as
those who esteem it our honor to call the Church of England,
from whence we arise, our dear mother, and cannot
part from our native country, where she specially resideth,
without much sadness of heart and many tears in our eyes;
ever acknowledging, that such hope and part as we have
obtained in the common salvation, we have received in
her bosom, and sucked it from her breasts. We leave it
not, therefore, as loathing that milk, wherewith we were
nourished, but blessing God for the parentage and education,
as members of the same body, shall always rejoice
in her good, and unfeignedly grieve for any sorrow that
shall ever betide her; and, while we have breath, sincerely
desire and endeavor the continuance and abundance of
her welfare, with the enlargement of her bounds in the
kingdom of Christ Jesus.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>There was, unquestionably, an entire sincerity in these
expressions of attachment to the Church of England.
There was, as they judged, no inconsistency in their subsequent
conduct, in forming churches, from which Episcopacy,
and all the ceremonies of the parent Church, were
excluded. Their love for that Church was founded on her
doctrines, not on her ceremonies. They recognised in
her articles the genuine faith, once delivered to the saints.
Her ceremonies they regarded as unseemly appendages,
the relics of Popish superstition, of which they desired to
divest her. They loved the inward spirit, not the outward
form. They did reverence to the majestic soul, while
they looked with sorrow on her fantastic attire. They
would have remained in her bosom, and submitted to much
which they deemed undesirable, if she would have permitted
them to reject what they considered as positively
unlawful and wrong. But as she left them no alternative
but unconditional submission, or exile, they departed for
America; and when they came to form churches here,
they endeavored to incorporate that soul in a body befitting
her dignity. The American church was, in their view,
the Church of England, redeemed and regenerated, holding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>to her former self a similar relation to that which the
just man made perfect bears to the saint who is still on
earth, and encumbered with his diseased and mortal body.</p>

<p class='c009'>A church was formed at Salem, on the 6th of August,
1629, when thirty persons entered into a covenant in writing,
and the Rev. Mr. Skelton was ordained, or instituted,
as the pastor, and the Rev. Mr. Higginson as the teacher;
these offices being considered as distinct, and both being
deemed essential to the welfare of a church. The
church thus formed was entirely independent. The Governor
of Plymouth, and other members of the church there,
who had been invited to attend the ceremony, were not
permitted to give the right hand of fellowship to the new
church, till an explicit declaration had been made, that
this service was not meant to indicate any right of interference
or control. The pastor and teacher were inducted
into office by the vote of the church, and by the imposition
of the hands of the ruling elder, as the organ of the church.
Thus careful were this body to exclude, at the outset, all
authority but that of the Head of the Church. Several of
the inhabitants, among whom Messrs. John and Samuel
Brown were the principal men, opposed the new church,
because the liturgy of the Church of England was rejected.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
They accordingly formed another society, in
which the book of common prayer was read. The schism
was speedily remedied, by a measure which was much
more energetic than just. Mr. John Brown and his brother,
the leaders, were sent to England, and their followers
quietly relinquished their opposition.</p>

<p class='c009'>A church was formed at Charlestown, July 30, 1630,
by Governor Winthrop and a number of other persons, who
signed a covenant, in which they simply promised to “walk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>in all our ways according to the rule of the Gospel, and in
all sincere conformity to his holy ordinances, and in mutual
love and respect to each other, so near as God shall give
us grace.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a> On the 27th of August, the Rev. John Wilson
was elected teacher. “We used imposition of hands,”
says Governor Winthrop, “but with this protestation by
all, that it was only as a sign of election and confirmation,
not of any intent that Mr. Wilson should renounce his
ministry he received in England.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Thus careful were
they to guard the independence of the church, while they
preserved due respect for the Church of England, whose
ministers, so far as they were pastors and teachers, they
acknowledged and honored.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Governor and the greater portion of the colonists
removed to Boston, the church, with the minister,
removed thither. It remained without a house for public
worship till August, 1632, when a building was commenced,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
on the south side of State street, opposite the
spot where the Branch Bank now stands. It was a humble
structure, with a thatched roof and mud walls.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Perhaps,
however, the metropolis has never seen a more devout
congregation than that which was accustomed to
assemble there. It well illustrates the piety of the founders,
and their high regard for the ministry, that at the first
Court of Assistants, held on board the Arbella, at Charlestown,
August 23, 1630, the first question propounded was,
<em>How shall the ministers be maintained?</em> It was ordered,
that houses be built for them with convenient speed, at the
public charge, and their salaries were established. These
were sufficiently moderate. Mr. Wilson was allowed twenty
pounds per annum, till his wife should arrive, and Mr.
Phillips, the minister of Watertown, was to receive thirty
pounds.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The ecclesiastical polity, now commenced, was afterwards
moulded into a more regular and permanent form,
by the personal influence of Mr. Cotton, and by the authority
of the platform adopted in 1648. The great principles
which were established were these: each church is independent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and possesses the sole power of governing itself,
according to the Scriptures; piety and a holy life are the
qualifications for church membership; the officers of a
church are pastors, teachers, ruling elders and deacons,
and are to be chosen by the church itself; the ordination of
ministers is to be performed with imposition of hands, by
the ministers of the neighboring churches. These and
other principles, which, with some exceptions, are still held
by the Independent, Congregational and Baptist churches,
were joined, with another article, which was the source of
manifold mischiefs to the colony. It is thus expressed, in
the words of Hubbard, (540): “Church government and
civil government may very well stand together, it being the
duty of the magistrate to take care of matters of religion,
and to improve his civil authority for observing the duties
commanded in the first as well as in the second table;
seeing the end of their office is not only the quiet and
peaceable life of the subject in matters of righteousness and
honesty, but also in matters of godliness.” 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ecclesiastical polity being adjusted, the civil government
was made to conform to it.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> To the excellent founders,
religion was the most precious of all interests, and
civil government was, in their view, useful, no further than
it was necessary for the good order of the community, and
the security of their religious privileges. Having escaped
from the grasp of the civil power in England, they resolved,
that in the new state to be formed here, the church should
hold the first place. They wished to erect here a community,
which should be itself a church, governed by the laws
of Jesus Christ, flourishing in the peace and beauty of
holiness, and realizing the glorious visions of the prophets.
It was a noble conception, a sublime purpose, of which
none but pure hearted men would have been capable. That
they failed in accomplishing all their plans, was the natural
result of human corruption; but they succeeded in forming
a community, more moral, more easily governed, better
educated, more thoroughly under the control of religious
principles, and more truly free, than the world had then
seen. At the General Court, held so early as May 18,
1631, it was ordered, that no person should be admitted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the privileges of a freeman, unless he was a member of
some church in the colony. This law was, no doubt, unjust,
and the colony was afterwards forced to repeal it. It
was, also, injurious to the interests of religion, for it made
church membership an object of earnest desire, for political
purposes, and thus introduced men without piety into the
church. It led to the adoption, to some extent, of the
ruinous principle, that piety is not necessary to church
membership, and it was one of the causes of that unhappy
strife, which issued in the introduction of the half-way
covenant.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a> But the law is characteristic of the founders,
and proves their determination to keep the state subordinate
to the church. They also adopted, as the basis of
their civil code, the laws of Moses, so far as they were of a
moral nature, though, as Roger Williams remarked, “they
extended their moral equity to so many particulars as to
take in the whole judicial law.” They punished crimes,
not by the laws of England, but by those of Moses. Idolatry,
blasphemy, man stealing, adultery, and some other
crimes, not punishable with death by the laws of the parent
country, were made capital. Every inhabitant was compelled
to contribute, in proportion to his ability, to the support
of religion. This adoption of the Mosaic code, and a
constant disposition to seek for precedents in the Old Testament,
will account for many of the measures which have
been attributed to the bigotry of our fathers.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Williams refuses to unite with the Boston church—is invited to
Salem—interference of the General Court—removes to Plymouth—the
Indians—difficulties at Plymouth—birth of Mr. Williams’
eldest child.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 5th of February, 1630–1,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a> as we have already
stated, Mr. Williams arrived in America, where he was to
become one of the founders of a great nation. As a
minister of the Gospel, he would naturally seek, without
delay, for an opportunity to fulfil his office. He was, it is
probable, without property, and a sense of duty would concur
with the dictates of prudence, to urge him to inquire
for some situation where he might be useful, while he obtained
a maintenance. The church in Boston were supplied
with a pastor, and the great Cotton was expected to
become their teacher. There was, however, another difficulty
to which we shall soon have occasion to recur.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few weeks after Mr. Williams’ arrival, he was invited
by the church at Salem to become an assistant to Mr.
Skelton, as teacher, in the place of the accomplished Higginson,
who died a few months before. Mr. Williams
complied with the invitation, and commenced his ministry
in that town. But the civil authority speedily interfered, in
accordance with the principle afterwards established in the
platform, that “if any church, one or more, shall grow
schismatical, rending itself from the communion of
other churches, or shall walk incorrigibly and obstinately in
any corrupt way of their own, contrary to the rule of the
word; in such case, the magistrate is to put forth his
coercive power, as the matter shall require.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>On the 12th of April, says Governor Winthrop (vol. i. p.
53) “at a Court, holden at Boston, (upon information to
the Governor, that they of Salem had called Mr. Williams
to the office of teacher,) a letter was written from the Court
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>to Mr. Endicott to this effect: That whereas Mr. Williams
had refused to join with the congregation at Boston, because
they would not make a public declaration of their repentance
for having communion with the churches of England,
while they lived there; and besides, had declared his
opinion that the magistrate might not punish a breach of
the Sabbath, nor any other offence, as it was a breach of
the first table; therefore they marvelled they would choose
him without advising with the Council; and withal desiring
him that they would forbear to proceed till they had conferred
about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The first of these charges is made in very indefinite
terms.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a> It does not appear, what was the degree of
conformity which the members of the church had practised
in England, nor what degree of criminality was, in the
estimation of Mr. Williams, attributable to their conduct.
It is well known, that some of the Puritans did maintain,
till they left England, a connection with the church, from
whose ritual they secretly dissented, and whose corruptions
they deeply deplored. We have already stated, that
Governor Winthrop and his associates had not separated
from the church when they left England, but acknowledged
themselves, at the moment of their departure, as among her
children. Many good men considered this conformity as a
pusillanimous and sinful connivance at evil, tending to
sanction and perpetuate the corruptions of the church.
Mr. Cotton himself, being forced, by the intolerance of the
hierarchy, either to submit to their ritual, or to suffer the
vengeance of the High Commission Court, resolved to
leave England. He travelled in disguise to London.
“Here,” says Cotton Mather, (Magnalia, b. iii. chap. 1.
§ 18) “the Lord had a work for him to do, which he little
thought of. Some reverend and renowned ministers of our
Lord in that great city, who yet had not seen sufficient
reason to expose themselves unto persecution for the sake
of non-conformity, but looked upon the imposed ceremonies
as indifferent and sufferable trifles, and weighed not the
aspect of the second commandment upon all the parts and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>means of instituted worship, took this opportunity for a
conference with Mr. Cotton; being persuaded, that since
he was no passionate, but a very judicious man, they should
prevail with him rather to conform, than to leave his work
and his land. Upon the motion of a conference, Mr.
Cotton most readily yielded; and first, all their arguments
for conformity, together with Mr. Byfield’s, Mr. Whately’s,
and Mr. Sprint’s, were produced, all of which Mr. Cotton
answered, unto their wonderful satisfaction. Then he
gave his arguments for his non-conformity, and the reasons
why he must rather forego his ministry, or, at least, his
country, than wound his conscience with unlawful compliance;
the issue whereof was, that instead of bringing
Mr. Cotton back to what he had now forsaken, he brought
them off altogether from what they had hitherto practised.
Every one of those eminent persons, Dr. Goodwin, Mr.
Nye, and Mr. Davenport, now became all that he was, and
at last left the kingdom for their being so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If, then, these distinguished ministers had practised a
conformity which Mr. Cotton esteemed “unlawful,” and
which Cotton Mather seems to have considered as a breach
of the second commandment, it is probable, that many
private Christians had done the same. The members of
the Boston church had undoubtedly shared in these “compliances.”
But if Mr. Cotton could not conform, without
wounding his conscience, he must have thought the practice
criminal. There is no question, that Mr. Williams
was of the same opinion; and as his temper was more
ardent and bold than that of Mr. Cotton, his opposition to
what he must have regarded as highly censurable, would
naturally be strong and decided. It is not very surprising,
therefore, if, on his arrival in America, with a vivid sense
of recent wrong from the persecuting church, he was disinclined
to a cordial union with those who had, in any measure,
yielded to her despotic pretensions, and sanctioned, by
any acts of compliance, her unscriptural requirements.
We are not told, precisely, in what terms, and to what
extent, he wished the members of the Boston church to
express their repentance for their conduct. He, perhaps,
allowed his feelings to bias his judgment in this case, and
to make him forget his own principles of liberty of conscience;
but the facts to which we have alluded show,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>that his objections were not altogether frivolous, nor his
conduct the offspring of bigotry and caprice. It appears,
that his feelings were afterwards allayed; and while at
Plymouth, the next year, he communed with Governor
Winthrop and other gentlemen from Boston.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The other allegation, made in the extract from Winthrop,
that Mr. Williams denied the power of the civil magistrate
to punish men for violations of the first table of the law,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a>
that is, in other words, for the neglect, or the erroneous performance,
of their duties to God, is one, which, at this day,
needs little discussion. Time has wrought out a triumphant
vindication of this great principle. The doctrine, that
man is accountable to his Maker alone for his religious
opinions and practices, and is entitled to an unrestrained
liberty to maintain and enjoy them, provided that he does
not interfere with the rights of others, and with the civil
peace of society, has won for itself, in this country, at least,
a place among the undisputed principles of thought and
action. Ample experience has demonstrated, even in
New-England, the manifold evils which spring from intrusting
to civil rulers the power to legislate for the church, to
control the conscience, and to regulate the intercourse
between men and his Creator. We shall have occasion to
recur to this topic. It is sufficient now to say, that Mr.
Williams stood on the firm ground of truth and of enlightened
policy, when he denied to the civil magistrate the
right to interfere with the consciences of men.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a> There is
no allegation, that he failed, on this occasion, in due respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>for the constituted authorities; but he claimed the
right of a freeman to speak freely of their principles and
measures. His natural temperament would give warmth
and energy to his remonstrance. A calmer man than he
might have been moved, if, when driven from his native
land by intolerance, he found, in the country to which he
had fled, the same principles maintained, the same usurpation
of power over the conscience claimed, as a regular
attribute of the civil authority.</p>

<p class='c009'>It appears, therefore, that the General Court had little
cause for their interference between Mr. Williams and the
church at Salem. Their right to interfere, for any cause,
will not now be maintained by any man. That church,
though she was probably aware of the disapprobation and
meditated interference of the Court, seems to have disregarded
it, and on the 12th of April, the same day on which the
Court was held, received Mr. Williams, as her minister.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
She thus consulted her duty as well as her true interests.
Jesus Christ is the only King and Legislator of his church.
He has given her his statute book, and it is as inconsistent
with her duty, as it ought to be repugnant to her feelings,
to permit any attempt to abridge the rights which her Lord
has bestowed on her. The choice of her pastors and
teachers is one of her most sacred rights, and most important
duties. She is bound to exercise this high privilege,
in humble dependence on the teachings of divine wisdom,
but with a resolute resistance of attempts, from any quarter,
to control her election.</p>

<p class='c009'>Notwithstanding the unwarrantable proceedings of the
Court, which must have been offensive both to the principles
and the feelings of Mr. Williams, we find him, the
next month, (the 18th of May, 1631) taking the usual oath
on his admission as a freeman.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c010'><sup>[48]</sup></a> This fact is worthy of
notice, because it proves, that he was willing to honor the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>civil authorities, within their proper sphere, and that he
desired to become a permanent and useful citizen. It
shows, too, that he had no objection to an oath, when
administered in a proper manner, and for suitable ends.
At this very Court, the law was made, which excluded from
the rights of freemen every person, who was not a member
of some one of the churches. Whether the difficulty
which had already risen respecting Mr. Williams, had any
influence in producing this measure, cannot now be ascertained.</p>

<p class='c009'>Notwithstanding that the church at Salem had received
Mr. Williams, he was not permitted to remain in peace.
“Persecution,” says Dr. Bentley,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c010'><sup>[49]</sup></a> “instead of calm expostulation,
instantly commenced, and Williams, before the
close of summer, was obliged to retire to Plymouth.” That
this separation from the church at Salem was not a voluntary
one, on her part or on his, may be presumed, from the
fact, asserted by the historian of Salem just quoted, that “he
was embraced with joy at Salem, and throughout all his life
supported a high place in their affections, as a truly godly
man.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a> His return to that town, by their invitation, two
years after, is a satisfactory proof that the church there felt
a confidence in his piety, and an attachment to his person
and ministry.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c010'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>At Plymouth, Mr. Williams was received with much
respect, and became an assistant to Mr. Ralph Smith, the
pastor of the church there. Governor Bradford speaks of
Mr. Williams in honorable terms,<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c010'><sup>[52]</sup></a> and even Morton, who
was not much disposed to speak favorably of him, acknowledges
that he “was well accepted as an assistant in
the ministry.”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c010'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>During Mr. Williams’ residence at Plymouth, Governor
Winthrop, with Mr. Wilson, of Boston, and other gentlemen,
visited that town.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c010'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Winthrop’s account of the visit is
so strongly illustrative of the manners of those times, that
it may be properly inserted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“1632. September 25. The Governor, with Mr. Wilson,
pastor of Boston, and the two Captains, &amp;c. went aboard the
Lyon, and from thence Mr. Peirce carried them in his shallop
to Wessaguscus.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c010'><sup>[55]</sup></a> The next morning Mr. Peirce returned
to his ship, and the Governor and his company went on foot
to Plymouth, and came thither within the evening. The
Governor of Plymouth, Mr. William Bradford, (a very discreet
and grave man) with Mr. Brewster, the elder, and
some others, came forth and met them without the town,
and conducted them to the Governor’s house, where they
were very kindly entertained and feasted every day at several
houses. On the Lord’s day there was a sacrament,
which they did partake in; and in the afternoon Mr. Roger
Williams (according to their custom) propounded a question,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>to which the pastor, Mr. Smith, spake briefly; then Mr.
Williams prophesied; and after the Governor of Plymouth
spake to the question; after him, the elder; then some two
or three more of the congregation. Then the elder desired
the Governor of Massachusetts and Mr. Wilson, to speak
to it, which they did. When this was ended, the deacon,
Mr. Fuller, put the congregation in mind of their duty of
contribution; whereupon the Governor and all the rest
went down to the deacons’ seat, and put into the box, and
then returned.” Vol. i. p. 91.</p>

<p class='c009'>While at Plymouth, Mr. Williams enjoyed favorable
opportunities of intercourse with the Indians, who frequently
visited that town. It appears, too, that he made excursions
among them, to learn their manners and their language,
and thus to qualify himself to promote their welfare.
His whole life furnished evidence of the sincerity of his
declaration, in one of his letters, “My soul’s desire was, to
do the natives good.” He became acquainted with Massasoit,
or, as he was also called, Ousamequin, the sachem of
the Pokanokets, and father of the famous Philip. He also
formed an intimacy with Canonicus, the Narraganset sachem.
He secured the confidence of these savage chiefs,
by acts of kindness, by presents, and not less, perhaps, by
studying their language. He says, in a letter, written near
the close of his life, “God was pleased to give me a painful,
patient spirit, to lodge with them in their filthy smoky
holes, (even while I lived at Plymouth and Salem) to gain
their tongue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The effects of this intimacy with the sachems were very
important. We shall see, by his subsequent history, that
his success, in purchasing lands for himself and for the
other settlers in Rhode Island, was the result mainly of his
personal influence with the Indians. We discern, in these
preparatory measures, the hand of God, who was designing
to employ Mr. Williams as an instrument in establishing a
new colony, and in preserving New-England from the fury
of the savages.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is reason to believe, that for some time previously
to his banishment, he had conceived the idea of residing
among the Indians, and that in his intercourse with the
sachems, some propositions had been made respecting a
cession of land. His strong desire to benefit the natives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>was a sufficient inducement; and he had, perhaps, seen
such indications of the state of feeling towards him among
the colonists, as to awaken an apprehension that he would
not long be allowed to remain within their jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams continued about two years at Plymouth.
While there, we may easily believe, he uttered his sentiments
on those points which had occasioned his removal
from Salem, as well as on other subjects, in relation to
which his opinions were at variance with those of that age.
They were not acceptable to the principal personages at
Plymouth, though it does not appear that any public expression
of disapprobation was made by the church. His
heart was evidently drawn towards Salem, and being invited
to return,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c010'><sup>[56]</sup></a> to assist Mr. Skelton, whose declining
health unfitted him for his duties, Mr. Williams requested
a dismission from the church at Plymouth. Some of the
members were unwilling to be separated from him, and accompanied
him to Salem, after ineffectual efforts to detain
him at Plymouth.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c010'><sup>[57]</sup></a> But the ruling elder, Mr. Brewster,
prevailed on the church to dismiss him and his adherents.
Mr. Brewster probably disliked his opinions, and feared
that he would be successful in diffusing them at Plymouth.
He, therefore, alarmed the church, by expressing his fears,
that Mr. Williams would “run the same course of rigid
separation and anabaptistry, which Mr. John Smith, the
Se-Baptist, at Amsterdam, had done.”<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c010'><sup>[58]</sup></a> Anabaptism was
a spectre, which haunted the imaginations of the early settlers.
The word possessed a mysterious power of inspiring
terror and creating odium. It has, perhaps, been sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>employed to justify measures, which might else have
wanted the appearance of justice and humanity. It was
one of those terms, which, in the language of the most
original writer, perhaps, of this age—himself liable to the
charge of anabaptism<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c010'><sup>[59]</sup></a>—“can be made the symbol of all
that is absurd and execrable, so that the very sound of it
shall irritate the passions of the multitude, as dogs have
been taught to bark, at the name of a neighboring tyrant.”<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c010'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>While Mr. Williams was at Plymouth, his eldest daughter
was born there, in the first week in August, 1633.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c010'><sup>[61]</sup></a> She
was named Mary, after her mother.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Returns to Salem—Ministers Meetings—Court again interferes—the
rights of the Indians—his book against the patent—wearing of
veils—controversy about the cross in the colors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Williams left Plymouth probably about the end of
August, 1633.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c010'><sup>[62]</sup></a> He resumed his labors at Salem, as an
assistant to Mr. Skelton, though, for some cause, he was
not elected to any office till after Mr. Skelton’s death.
Perhaps the expectation of this event induced the church
to delay the election of Mr. Williams.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after his return to Salem, his watchful love of liberty
seems to have excited him, together with the venerable
Mr. Skelton, to express some apprehension of the tendencies
of a meeting, which several ministers had established,
for the ostensible and probably real purpose of
mutual improvement, and consultation respecting their duties,
and the interests of religion. Winthrop thus states,
under the date of November, 1633:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ministers in the Bay and Saugus did meet once a
fortnight, at one of their houses, by course, where some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>question of moment was debated. Mr. Skelton, the pastor
of Salem, and Mr. Williams, who was removed from Plymouth
thither, (but not in any office, though he exercised
by way of prophecy) took some exception against it, as
fearing it might grow in time to a presbytery or superintendency,
to the prejudice of the churches’ liberties. But
this fear was without cause; for they were all clear in that
point, that no church or person can have power over
another church; neither did they, in their meetings, exercise
any such jurisdiction.” Vol. i. p. 116.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be true, that the fears of Mr. Skelton and Mr.
Williams were without cause, and, in our own times, such
meetings of ministers are held, with much advantage to
themselves and to the churches, and without exciting
alarm. But before we decide, that Mr. Williams was unnecessarily
apprehensive, and especially before we accuse
him of a turbulent and factious temper, it deserves inquiry,
whether his experience of ecclesiastical usurpation and intolerance
in England might not justify the fear, that the
frequent consultations of the ministers were not ominous of
good to the independence of the churches and to liberty
of conscience. Mr. Skelton, however, seems to have
been the principal in this opposition.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c010'><sup>[63]</sup></a> It may have been
a good service to the cause of liberty and of religion. A
watchful dread of encroachments on civil or religious freedom
is not useless, in any age. It was a prominent trait
in the character of the colonists, before the revolution, and
it will always be cherished by a free people. It is a salutary
provision, like the sense of fear in the human bosom.
It may sometimes cause an unnecessary alarm, as the
watchman may arouse the city with an unfounded report
of danger. But these evils are preferable to the incautious
negligence, which fears not peril, and thus invites it.</p>

<p class='c009'>But more important causes of offence to the magistrates
and the clergy were soon found, in the sentiments and conduct
of Mr. Williams. So early as December 27, 1633,
we find the General Court again convened to consult respecting
him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“December 27. The Governor and Assistants met at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Boston, and took into consideration a treatise, which Mr.
Williams (then of Salem) had sent to them, and which he
had formerly written to the Governor and Council of Plymouth,
wherein, among other things, he disputed their
right to the lands they possessed here, and concluded that,
claiming by the King’s grant, they could have no title, nor
otherwise, except they compounded with the natives. For
this, taking advice with some of the most judicious ministers,
(who much condemned Mr. Williams’ error and presumption)
they gave order, that he should be convented at
the next Court, to be censured, &amp;c. There were three
passages chiefly whereat they were much offended: 1. for
that he chargeth King James to have told a solemn public
lie, because, in his patent, he blessed God that he was the
first Christian prince that had discovered this land: 2. for
that he chargeth him and others with blasphemy, for calling
Europe Christendom, or the Christian world: 3. for
that he did personally apply to our present King, Charles,
these three places in the Revelations, viz: [blank.]<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c010'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Endicott being absent, the Governor wrote to him
to let him know what was done, and withal added divers
arguments to confute the said errors, wishing him to deal
with Mr. Williams to retract the same, &amp;c. Whereto he
returned a very modest and discreet answer. Mr. Williams
also wrote to the Governor, and also to him and the rest of
the Council very submissively, professing his intent to have
been only to have written for the private satisfaction of the
Governor, &amp;c. of Plymouth, without any purpose to have
stirred any further in it, if the Governor here had not required
a copy of him; withal offering his book, or any part
of it, to be burnt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the next Court he appeared <em>penitently</em>, and gave satisfaction
of his intention and loyalty. So it was left, and
nothing done in it.” Vol. i. p. 122.</p>

<p class='c009'>The book, which occasioned these transactions, has not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>been preserved.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c010'><sup>[65]</sup></a> We know not in what terms Mr. Williams
uttered his offensive opinions. The doctrine which
he maintained, that the charter from the King of England
could not convey to the colonists the right to occupy the
lands of the Indians, without their consent, is, in the highest
degree, honorable to his head and his heart. He clearly
saw the utter absurdity and injustice of the pretension,
whether made by the Pope or by a Protestant monarch, of
sovereignty over other countries, merely on the ground of
prior discovery, or of the barbarous and wandering character
of the inhabitants. It may be a useful regulation
among nations, that the first discoverers of a country shall
possess a superior right to intercourse with the inhabitants
for trade or other purposes. But no people, whether Pagans
or Christians, can rightfully be subjected to a sway,
to which they have not voluntarily submitted. This fundamental
principle of human rights applies to the Indians.
They were independent tribes, and could, in no sense, be
considered as the subjects of the King of England. The
fact, that some of his vessels had sailed along their coasts,
no more gave him a title to be their sovereign, than the
passage of one of their canoes up the Thames would have
transferred to Canonicus or Powhatan a claim to the crown
of England. If the King possessed no jurisdiction over the
Indians, he could not, of course, convey a title to their
lands. It was this point on which Mr. Williams insisted
with special earnestness. “His own account of this matter,”
says Mr. Backus, (vol. i. p. 58,) “informs us, that the
sin of the patents which lay so heavy on his mind was, that
therein ‘Christian Kings (so called) are invested with a
right, by virtue of their <em>Christianity</em>, to take and give away
the lands and countries of other men.’<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c010'><sup>[66]</sup></a> And he tells us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>that this evil so deeply afflicted his soul, that ‘before his
troubles and banishment, he drew up a letter, not without
the approbation of some of the chiefs of New-England,
then tender also upon this point before God, directed unto
the King himself, humbly acknowledging the evil of <span class='fss'>THAT
PART</span> of the patent, which respects the donation of lands,’”
&amp;c.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c010'><sup>[67]</sup></a> And the colonists themselves acted, generally, on
the very principle which Mr. Williams advocated. They
purchased the lands of the natives, for a trifling recompense,
as it may seem to us, but such as satisfied the Indians.
Cotton Mather states, though he reckons it as a
proof of <em>civility</em>, that “notwithstanding the patent which
they had for the country, they fairly purchased of the natives
the several tracts of land which they afterwards possessed.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c010'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
Dr. Dwight asserts, that “exclusively of the
country of the Pequods, the inhabitants of Connecticut
bought, unless I am deceived, every inch of ground contained
within that colony, of its native proprietors. The
people of Rhode-Island, Plymouth, Massachusetts and
New-Hampshire, proceeded wholly in the same equitable
manner. Until Philip’s war, in 1675, not a single foot of
ground was claimed or occupied by the colonists on any
other score but that of fair purchase.”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c010'><sup>[69]</sup></a> These facts are
honorable to the pilgrims, and assuredly Roger Williams is
entitled to some praise for steadily advocating this policy
from the beginning. He, perhaps, construed the patent
with too much rigor. The King did not, it may be, mean
all that his lofty royal style implied. In his patent to the
Plymouth Company, he alludes to the “wonderful plague”
which had raged among the natives, and left the “large
and goodly territories deserted as it were by the natural inhabitants.”
He nevertheless calls himself the “sovereign
lord” of the whole continent, and therefore by his “special
grace, mere motion, and certain knowledge,” gives and
grants to the Company a large part of the continent, from
sea to sea, without intimating that any rights belonged to
the natives. A warm friend to the Indians might easily
construe such an instrument as a designed and flagrant
usurpation of their rights. We have seen how the colonists
of New-England practised under the patent, and Mr. Cotton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in his reply to Roger Williams, affirms: “It was
neither the King’s intendment, nor the English planters’,
to take possession of the country by murder or by robbery,
but either to take possession of the void places of the country,
by the law of nature, (for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vacuum domicilium cedit occupanti</span></i>)
or if we took any lands from the natives, it was
by way of purchase and free consent. We have not our
land merely by right of patent from the King, but that the
natives are true owners of all that they possess or improve.
Neither do I know any amongst us, that either then were, or
now are, of another mind.” Bloody Tenet Washed, p. 26.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this subject deserves a more full consideration than
we can here give it. The suggestions now offered may
suffice to exhibit the upright integrity and sound judgment
which drew from Mr. Williams his declarations in favor of
the natives. It seems, that his book discussed the abstract
question, and probably it was called forth by some expression
of the opposite doctrine. It was not intended for the
public eye, but was a private communication to the Governor
and other gentlemen of Plymouth. He could not be
charged with a public attack in this book on the charter.
Nor is it certain, that he questioned the authority of the
charter, so far as it could operate without an infringement
of the rights of the Indians. He was, indeed, charged by
Mr. Cotton (Hubbard, 210) with insisting that the charter
ought to be returned to the King. This would certainly
have been very unwise, but we can hardly suppose that Mr.
Williams would carry his opposition to this unreasonable
length. Winthrop does not intimate that any such opinion
was expressed, and Mr. Cotton may have misunderstood
Mr. Williams’ real meaning.</p>

<p class='c009'>In regard to the passages which were construed as disrespectful
to the King, it may be sufficient to say, that his
own words are not reported; and at a meeting of the Court,
in January, the magistrates and the clergy acknowledged
that they had taken unnecessary offence. It is probable
that they misunderstood him. Winthrop says, under date
of January 24, 1633–4: “The Governor and Council met
again at Boston, to consider of Mr. Williams’ letter, &amp;c.
when, with the advice of Mr. Cotton and Mr. Wilson, and
weighing his letter, and further considering of the aforesaid
offensive passages in his book, (which being written in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>very obscure and implicative phrases, might well admit of
doubtful interpretation,) they found the matters not to be so
evil as at first they seemed. Whereupon they agreed, that,
upon his retraction, &amp;c. or taking an oath of allegiance to
the King, &amp;c. it should be passed over.” Vol. i. p. 123.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conduct of Mr. Williams on this occasion was, it
must be acknowledged, mild and conciliatory. He offered
to burn the offensive book, though he did not retract his
opinions. He wrote to the Court, we are told, “submissively,”
and afterwards appeared before them “penitently,”
and furnished satisfactory evidence of his “loyalty.” We
cannot determine, how far these expressions may be construed
to imply an acknowledgment of error on the part
of Mr. Williams; but they are valuable, as a proof that he
was not so obstinate and contumacious as the world have
been taught to regard him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was now permitted, for a while, to continue his ministry
at Salem, without interruption from the magistrates.
He was popular as a preacher, and the people at Salem became
strongly attached to him. Mr. Skelton died in August,
1634, and Mr. Williams was soon after invited to become
the teacher of the church. The magistrates sent to
the church a request, that they would not ordain him; but
the church persisted, and Mr. Williams was regularly introduced
to the office of teacher.</p>

<p class='c009'>This “great contempt of authority,” as it was afterwards
pronounced to be by the magistrates and ministers, was not
forgotten. We shall soon see how it was punished.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may here take notice of two charges against Mr.
Williams, which, trivial as they are, have been often alleged
to his disadvantage. It has been said, that he
preached on the use of veils by females, and insisted that
they should wear them in religious assemblies. We have
no record of his real sentiments on this frivolous subject.
Dr. Bentley asserts, that Mr. Endicott had introduced it
before Mr. Williams arrived, and that the latter adopted
the notion, rather to gratify Mr. Endicott and Mr. Skelton,
than because he felt any interest in it himself.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c010'><sup>[70]</sup></a> And if it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>were true, that he was the author of the custom, and wasted
his time in establishing it, we should regard it as a venial
weakness, springing from a reverence for the Scriptures,
and a desire for the decorum of public worship. Before
we condemn him, we should call to mind, that other divines
of great name in New-England, such as President
Chauncy and John Elliot, preached vehemently against
wigs, and that, in 1649, the magistrates signed a grave
protest against the custom among men of wearing long
hair, and requested the clergy to preach against it, “as a
thing uncivil and unmanly, whereby men do deform themselves,
and offend sober and modest men, and do corrupt
good manners.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c010'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The other charge is of more importance. It is said, that
in consequence of Mr. Williams’ preaching, Mr. Endicott
cut the cross out of the military colors, as a relic of antichristian
superstition. This act was doubtless unjustifiable,
because the colors were established by the authority of
the King, and ought to have been viewed as a merely civil
regulation. But there is no evidence that Mr. Williams
advised the measure. It seems rather to have been a practical
application, by Mr. Endicott, of the doctrine maintained
by Mr. Williams on the unlawfulness of the ceremonies
and symbols which had been used in the service of idolatry
and of Popery. The great controversy between the Puritans
and the Prelates in England mainly turned on the use
of the surplice, and the sign of the cross, and other Popish
ceremonies, which the English Church retained. The
Puritans would not conform to the church, on account of
these ceremonies, which they regarded as abominable relics
of Popery. It was a principle among them, on which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>acted, that “such rites and ceremonies as had been abused
to idolatry, and manifestly tended to lead men back to
Popery and superstition, were no longer indifferent, but to
be rejected as unlawful.”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c010'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams probably preached this doctrine at Salem,
and Mr. Endicott deemed it his duty, as a magistrate, to
remove from the colors the cross, which was the favorite
symbol of Popery.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c010'><sup>[73]</sup></a> Dr. Bentley asserts, that Mr. Williams
was the “<em>innocent</em>, though the <em>real</em> cause of it.”<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c010'><sup>[74]</sup></a> Mr.
Endicott was summoned before the Court, admonished,
and declared incapable, for one year, of holding any public
office, as a punishment for the act; but neither he, nor the
Court, appear to have attributed any blame to Mr. Williams,
which we may, without a want of charity, suppose they
would have done, if there had been any reasonable pretence.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Proceedings which led to his banishment—freeman’s oath—various
charges against him—sentence—birth of his second child—leaves
Salem for Narraganset Bay—review of the causes of his banishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>We will now proceed to narrate the measures which
issued in the banishment of Mr. Williams. We shall follow
the guidance of Winthrop, as to the facts, because this
truly great man wrote without the angry temper which
most of the early writers on the subject exhibited.</p>

<p class='c009'>“1634, Nov. 27. The Court was informed, that Mr.
Williams, of Salem, had broken his promise to us, in teaching
publicly against the King’s patent, and our great sin in
claiming right thereby to this country, &amp;c. and for usual
terming the churches of England antichristian. We granted
summons to him for his appearance at the next Court.”
Winthrop, vol. i. p. 151.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are not informed of the terms of Mr. Williams’
promise, here referred to, and cannot decide how far he
had broken it. The epithet which he is said to have applied
to the churches in England, might, in his judgment,
have been well deserved by many of them. He, of course,
referred to the established churches, then practising, as
the Puritans believed, idolatrous ceremonies, and under the
direction of wicked men. Mr. Cotton, in his “Bloody
Tenet Washed,” (p. 109) acknowledges it to be a source of
grief to himself and others, “that there is yet so much of
those notorious evils still continuing in the parishes, (in
England) worldliness, ignorance, superstition, scoffing,
swearing, cursing, whoredom, drunkenness, theft, lying; I
may add, also, murder, and malignity against the godly,
suffered to thrust themselves into the fellowship of the
churches, and to sit down with the saints at the Lord’s table.”
We may be allowed to think, that Roger Williams
was not remarkably bigoted, if he did call such churches
as these antichristian, and deem it a sin to hold fellowship
with them. He obeyed the summons of the Court:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“1635, Mo. 2, 30.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c010'><sup>[75]</sup></a> The Governor and Assistants sent
for Mr. Williams. The occasion was, for that he had taught
publicly, that a magistrate ought not to tender an oath to
an unregenerate man, for that we thereby have communion
with a wicked man in the worship of God, and cause him
to take the name of God in vain. He was heard before all
the ministers, and very clearly confuted. Mr. Endicott
was at first of the same opinion, but he gave place to the
truth.” Vol. i. p. 157.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may repeat, here, what, ought to be constantly borne
in mind, that the statements of Mr. Williams’ opinions come,
not from himself, but from his opponents. We need not
insist on the liability to mistake, in cases where a man’s
sentiments are thus disjoined from all those explanations
and arguments with which he would himself have accompanied
them. In the present case, we are not informed of
the precise views of Mr. Williams respecting oaths.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c010'><sup>[76]</sup></a> He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>had taken the freeman’s oath in 1631. Many others have
entertained doubts of the propriety of oaths, in any case,
and our laws allow an individual, who feels these scruples,
to substitute an affirmation. The unlawfulness of all oaths
might be plausibly argued, from the words of our Saviour,
Matthew, v. 34, and from those of the Apostle James, v. 12.
On this ground, however, they would be equally unlawful
to all men, and the distinction which Mr. Williams is said
to have made between Christians and unregenerate men
could not be sustained. If, however, an oath were considered,
as he viewed it, as a religious act, implying devout
reverence for the Supreme Being, a fear of His displeasure
and desire of His favor, it would not be easy to show how an
irreligious man can sincerely take an oath. Mr. Williams
had probably seen oaths taken in England with such scandalous
levity, and used for purposes so iniquitous, as to
awaken in his mind a strong aversion to their being administered
indiscriminately to the pious and the profane. We
may, nevertheless, admit, that he was unnecessarily scrupulous
on this point, without impeaching either his piety or
his judgment. The ministers seem to have been satisfied
with their success in confuting him. It is usual for disputants
to claim the victory. Perhaps if Mr. Williams had
recorded the event, he might have told us of the unimpaired
vigor of his arguments. We have reason to believe, however,
that the offensiveness of Mr. Williams’ opinions respecting
oaths consisted not so much in his abstract objections
to their use, as in his opposition to the new oath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of fidelity which the Court thought proper to require of the
citizens. Mr. Cotton<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c010'><sup>[77]</sup></a> states the case thus: “The magistrates
and other members of the General Court, upon intelligence
of some Episcopal and malignant practices against
the country, made an order of Court, to take trial of the
fidelity of the people, not by imposing upon them, but by
offering to them, an oath of fidelity, that in case any should
refuse to take it, they might not betrust them with place of
public charge and command. This oath, when it came
abroad, he (Mr. Williams) vehemently withstood, and dissuaded
sundry from it, partly because it was, he said,
Christ’s prerogative to have his office established by an
oath; partly because an oath was part of God’s worship,
and God’s worship was not to be put upon carnal persons,
as he conceived many of the people to be. So the Court
was forced to desist from that proceeding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The reasons assigned by Mr. Cotton for Mr. Williams’
opposition to the oath are, we suspect, not all the reasons
which really moved him to this course. He probably
viewed the act of the Court in absolving the citizens from
the oath which they had already taken, and substituting
another, as an illegal assumption of power. It might be
understood to claim for the Court an authority superior to
the charter, for it omitted the clause of the former oath,
which required of the subject obedience to laws which
should be “lawfully” made by the Court, and, instead of
it, obliged men to swear to submit to the “<em>wholesome</em>” regulations
which might be established. As the charter prohibited
the passage of laws contrary to the laws of England,
the first oath bound the citizen to obey the Court
only while they adhered to the charter; but the new oath
required submission to all the “wholesome” acts of the
government, who were, of course, the sole judges of the
wholesomeness of their own measures. Mr. Cotton says,
that the oath was only <em>offered</em>, not imposed, but it was, by
a subsequent act of the Court, enforced on every man
above the age of sixteen years, on penalty of punishment at
the discretion of the Court.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c010'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>To this oath, under such circumstances, Mr. Williams,
as a friend of liberty, was opposed. He would not renounce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>an oath which he had taken, and substitute another,
which bound him to obey whatever laws the magistrates
might deem wholesome. The reason assigned for the new
oath, moreover, was to guard against “Episcopal and malignant
practices.” This gave it the appearance of a law
to restrain liberty of conscience; and Mr. Williams’ principles
were totally opposed to any measure which tended to
that result, however specious its professed object might be.</p>

<p class='c009'>If these views are correct, Mr. Williams’ opposition to
oaths in this case resolves itself into an inflexible adherence
to his great doctrine of unfettered religious liberty; a doctrine
which, more than any thing else, drew upon him the
jealousy and dislike of the magistrates and the clergy.</p>

<p class='c009'>In July, he was again summoned to Boston.</p>

<p class='c009'>“1635, Mo. 5, 8. At the General Court, Mr. Williams,
of Salem, was summoned and did appear. It was laid to
his charge, that being under question before the magistracy
and churches for divers dangerous opinions, viz: 1. that
the magistrate ought not to punish the breach of the first
table, otherwise than in such cases as did disturb the civil
peace; 2. that he ought not to tender an oath to an unregenerate
man; 3. that a man ought not to pray with such,
though wife, child, &amp;c.; 4. that a man ought not to give
thanks after the sacrament, nor after meat, &amp;c.; and that
the other churches were about to write to the church of
Salem to admonish him of these errors; notwithstanding,
the church had since called him to [the] office of teacher.
Much debate was about these things. The said opinions
were adjudged by all, magistrates and ministers, (who were
desired to be present) to be erroneous and very dangerous,
and that the calling of him to office, at that time, was
judged a great contempt of authority. So, in fine, time
was given to him and the church of Salem to consider
of these things till the next General Court, and then either
to give satisfaction to the Court, or else to expect the sentence;
it being professedly declared by the ministers (at
the request of the Court to give their advice) that he who
should obstinately maintain such opinions (whereby a
church might run into heresy, apostacy, or tyranny, and
yet the civil magistrate could not intermeddle) were to be
removed, and that the other churches ought to request the
magistrates so to do.” Vol. i. p. 162.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The first two of these charges have been considered. It
will be observed, that the Governor has candidly acknowledged,
that Mr. Williams allowed it to be right for the civil
magistrate to punish breaches of the first table, when they
disturbed the civil peace. This fact exempts him from
the charge of opposition to the civil authority.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third charge, if it is a true representation of the
opinion of Mr. Williams, shows that his judgment in this
particular was biased, by an idea of the impropriety of
uniting in religious worship with those who cannot cordially
participate in the service. He thus carried to an extreme
a principle, which the state of things in England had frequently
called into exercise. He probably recollected, that
the book of common prayer implied that all present adopted
the petitions as their own; and as he knew that many
who pretended to join in the worship were notoriously
profligate, he might be impelled to the opposite error.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c010'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>The fourth charge seems too frivolous for notice. What
right have men to insist on ceremonies which the Bible
does not enjoin, and which are in themselves indifferent?
If, as is not improbable,<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c010'><sup>[80]</sup></a> there was an attempt to introduce
among the churches a uniformity touching these little
observances, it is not wonderful that Mr. Williams resisted
them. He had seen too much of this system in England,
to be willing to submit to it in America.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the Salem church adhered to Mr. Williams, notwithstanding
the well-known displeasure of the magistrates and
the clergy, a singular mode of punishing them for their
contumacy was soon adopted. Three days after the session
of the Court just mentioned, we are told by Winthrop,
that the “Salem men had preferred a petition at the last
General Court, for some land in Marblehead Neck, which
they did challenge as belonging to their town; but, because
they had chosen Mr. Williams their teacher, while he stood
under question of authority, and so offered contempt to the
magistrates, &amp;c. their petition was refused till, &amp;c. Upon
this the church of Salem write to other churches to admonish
the magistrates of this as a heinous sin, and likewise
the deputies; for which, at the next General Court, their
deputies were not received until they should give satisfaction
about the letter.” Vol. i. p. 164.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here is a candid avowal, that justice was refused to
Salem, on a question of civil right, as a punishment for the
conduct of the church and pastor. A volume could not
more forcibly illustrate the danger of a connection between
the civil and ecclesiastical power. The land, in question,
was granted, after Mr. Williams was banished. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>postponement was evidently designed, and probably had
some effect, to induce the people of Salem to consent to
their pastor’s removal.</p>

<p class='c009'>The church at Salem felt this to be a flagrant wrong,
and they naturally wrote to the other churches, to warn
them of this dangerous attack upon their liberty, and to request
them to admonish the magistrates, as members of
the churches, of the criminality of their conduct. It is
difficult to see, why the church at Salem were not fully
justified in this procedure.</p>

<p class='c009'>The health of Mr. Williams failed under the pressure of
his trials and duties. He declared, “that his life was in
danger, by his excessive labors, preaching thrice a week,
by labors night and day in the field; and by travels night
and day, to go and come from the Court.” We need not
be surprised, therefore, at the next notice of him by Winthrop,
under the date of August 16:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Williams, pastor of Salem, being sick and not able
to speak, wrote to his church a protestation, that he could
not communicate with the churches in the Bay; neither
would he communicate with them, except they would refuse
communion with the rest: but the whole church was grieved
herewith.” Vol. i. p. 166.</p>

<p class='c009'>Solomon has said, that “oppression maketh a wise man
mad;”<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c010'><sup>[81]</sup></a> and it is not wonderful that it should impel a sick
man to write such a letter as the one here alluded to. Mr.
Williams felt deeply that he had been injured, and that the
spiritual fellowship between him and the churches had
suffered a melancholy interruption. He therefore declared,
that he could not commune with them, and he insisted that
the church in Salem should refuse such a communion. In
this conduct he was doubtless wrong, yet who will venture
to say, that if he had been placed in the situation of Mr.
Williams, he would have maintained a more subdued spirit?</p>

<p class='c009'>Matters now rapidly approached a crisis. The magistrates
punished with rigor the offence of the Salem church,
or rather of Mr. Williams, in writing the letter to the other
churches. Mr. Endicott was committed, for justifying that
letter, and was not discharged, till he acknowledged his offence.
The following extract from the records of the Court
shows a case, which savours much of the English Court of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>High Commission: “Mr. Samuel Sharpe is enjoined to
appear at the next Particular Court, to answer for the letter
that came from the church of Salem, as also <em>to bring the
names of those that will justify the same</em>, or else to acknowledge
his offence, under his own hand, for his own particular.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c010'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In October, Mr. Williams was called before the Court for
the last time:</p>

<p class='c009'>“At this General Court, Mr. Williams, the teacher of Salem,
was again convented, and all the ministers in the Bay being
desired to be present, he was charged with the said two letters,
that to the churches, complaining of the magistrates
for injustice, extreme oppression, &amp;c. and the other to his
own church, to persuade them to renounce communion
with all the churches in the Bay, as full of antichristian
pollution, &amp;c. He justified both these letters, and maintained
all his opinions; and, being offered further conference
or disputation, and a month’s respite, he chose to dispute
presently. So Mr. Hooker was chosen to dispute with him,
but could not reduce him from any of his errors. So, the
next morning, the Court sentenced him to depart out of our
jurisdiction within six weeks, all the ministers, save one,
approving the sentence; and his own church had him under
question also for the same cause; and he, at his return home,
refused communion with his own church, who openly disclaimed
his errors, and wrote an humble submission to the
magistrates, acknowledging their fault in joining with Mr.
Williams in that letter to the churches against them,” &amp;c.
Vol. i. p. 171.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sentence was in these terms: “Whereas Mr. Roger
Williams, one of the elders of the church of Salem, hath
broached and divulged divers new and dangerous opinions,
against the authority of magistrates; as also writ letters of
defamation, both of the magistrates and churches here, and
that before any conviction, and yet maintaineth the same
without any retractation; it is therefore ordered, that the
said Mr. Williams shall depart out of this jurisdiction within
six weeks now next ensuing, which, if he neglect to perform,
it shall be lawful for the Governor and two of the magistrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to send him to some place out of this jurisdiction, not
to return any more without license from the Court.”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c010'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The conduct of the church at Salem is to be ascribed to
the severe measures of the magistrates, rather than to hostility
to Mr. Williams. Many of them accompanied or followed
him in his exile. Neal, in his History of New-England,
acknowledges, that when he was banished, “the whole
town of Salem was in an uproar, for he was esteemed an
honest, disinterested man, and of popular talents in the pulpit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams received permission to remain at Salem till
spring, but because he would not refrain, <em>in his own house</em>,
from uttering his opinions, the Court resolved to send him
to England, in order to remove, as far as possible, the infection
of his principles. Happily for themselves, and for the
country, their design was defeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“11 mo. January. The Governor and Assistants met at
Boston to consider about Mr. Williams, for that they were
credibly informed, that, notwithstanding the injunction laid
upon him (upon the liberty granted him to stay till the
spring,) not to go about to draw others to his opinions, he
did use to entertain company in his house, and to preach to
them, even of such points as he had been censured for; and
it was agreed to send him into England by a ship then ready
to depart. The reason was, because he had drawn above
twenty persons to his opinion, and they were intended to
erect a plantation about the Narraganset Bay, from whence
the infection would easily spread into these churches, (the
people being many of them much taken with the apprehension
of his godliness.) Whereupon a warrant was sent to
him to come presently to Boston to be shipped, &amp;c. He
returned answer (and divers of Salem came with it,) that
he could not come without hazard of his life, &amp;c. Whereupon
a pinnace was sent with commission to Capt. Underhill,
&amp;c. to apprehend him, and carry him aboard the ship,
(which then rode at Nantasket;) but, when they came at
his house, they found he had been gone three days before;
but whither they could not learn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He had so far prevailed at Salem, as many there, (especially
of devout women) did embrace his opinions, and separated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>from the churches, for this cause, that some of their
members, going into England, did hear the ministers there,
and when they came home the churches here held communion
with them.” Vol. i. p. 175.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams had received notice of the design of the
Court, and had left Salem, in quest of a quiet refuge
in the neighborhood of Narraganset Bay. It appears,
that Governor Winthrop had privately advised him to leave
the colony, as a measure, which the public peace required,
and by which the personal interests of Mr. Williams might
ultimately be best promoted. The good of the Indians,
also, was a motive which operated on both their minds. Mr.
Williams says, in a letter which has already been quoted:
“It pleased the Most High to direct my steps into this Bay, by
the loving private advice of the ever honored soul, Mr. John
Winthrop, the grandfather, who, though he were carried
with the stream for my banishment, yet he tenderly loved
me to his last breath.” The same fact is asserted, in the
letter to Major Mason,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c010'><sup>[84]</sup></a> and the advice of Governor Winthrop
is ascribed to “many high, and heavenly, and public
ends.” The friendship of the Governor was manifested on
various occasions, and he afterwards united with Mr. Williams
in the purchase of the island of Prudence in Narraganset
Bay.</p>

<p class='c009'>The removal, however, if it might on general grounds
have been expedient, was not now optional. Without considering
the justice or injustice of his banishment, there was
certainly great hardship in being forced from his home in
the middle of winter. His second daughter was born in
the latter part of October, 1635,<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c010'><sup>[85]</sup></a> and was consequently an
infant less than three months old, while his eldest child was
but a little more than two years of age. The mother and
her two infants he left behind. His house and land at Salem
he mortgaged, to raise money for the supply of his wants.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c010'><sup>[86]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>With a heavy heart must this exiled husband and father,
and this affectionate pastor, have parted from his family
and flock, and plunged into the wilderness, to endure the
wintry storms, and to try the hospitality of the savages.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have thus briefly examined the reasons assigned by
the mild and candid Winthrop for the expulsion of Mr.
Williams from Massachusetts. We have seen, that these
reasons related almost entirely to opinions, which the magistrates
thought to be dangerous, and which the clergy opposed
as tending to schism. It is satisfactory to observe, however,
that these opinions did not refer to any of the great
principles of the Gospel. The religious doctrines which
Mr. Williams preached before his banishment were the same
as those of Cotton and Hooker. He was not accused, while
at Plymouth or at Salem, of any deviation from the established
principles of the churches, on points of faith, much
less was there any impeachment of his moral character. It
is confessed, by the most bitter of his opponents, that both
at Plymouth and at Salem, he was respected and beloved, as
a pious man, and able minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>What was there, then, it may be inquired, in the opinions
of Mr. Williams, which was so offensive to the rulers in
church and state? His denial of the right to possess the
lands of the Indians without their own consent, needed not
to disturb the colonists, for they purchased their lands from
the natives. His ideas of the unlawfulness of oaths, and of
the impropriety of praying with unregenerate persons, and
other harmless notions of this kind, were surely too unimportant
to excite the fears and provoke the ire of the government.
We are led to the conclusion, that the cause of
Mr. Williams’ banishment is to be found in the great principle
which has immortalized his name, that <span class='fss'>THE CIVIL
POWER HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE CONSCIENCE</span>. This
noble doctrine, which the Scriptures clearly teach, and
which reason itself proclaims, was, at that time, viewed, by
most men, to be as heterodox, in morals, as the Copernican
theory was considered by the Inquisition to be false in philosophy;
and he who maintained it was liable to the fate of Galileo.
The Papists abhorred it, for it would have subverted
the Papal throne. The English Church rejected it, for it
would have wrested from the hierarchy its usurped authority,
and led the Church away from the throne of an earthly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>monarch to the footstool of the King of kings, as her
only head and sovereign. The Puritans themselves disowned
it, for they were so firmly convinced of the truth of
their doctrines, that they deemed him, who was so obstinate
as not to embrace them, to be worthy of punishment for acting
in opposition to his own conscience.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c010'><sup>[87]</sup></a> They refused to conform
to the ceremonies of the English Church, but it was
because they believed those ceremonies to be idolatrous, and
not because they denied to men the power to enforce the
belief of doctrines and the practice of rites. They opposed
the Prelates, but they believed that a similar sway might
be safely intrusted to their own hands. They resisted and
for a while triumphed over the Lords Bishops, but they forgot
that the despotism of the Lords Brethren, as Blackstone
termed them, might be quite as intolerable. They did not
understand the nature of that liberty which the Gospel bestows.
They were misled by the analogies which they drew
from the Mosaic institutions, and felt it to be their duty
to extirpate heresy, with as unsparing rigor, as the Jews were
required to exercise against those who despised or violated
their ritual.</p>

<p class='c009'>The character of the Puritans has been greatly misunderstood
on this point, and there has been much common-place
declamation respecting their bigotry and inconsistency
in persecuting others, after having suffered persecution
themselves. But a candid mind, which understands
their principles, will not, while it must lament and condemn
their conduct, use the language of harsh censure. They
were so far from believing, that liberty of conscience in religious
concerns ought to be extended to all men, that they
regarded toleration as a crime. They argued, that they ought
to promote truth, and oppose error, by all the methods in
their power. If they were able to suppress false doctrines,
it was, they believed, a solemn duty to God to employ force,
if necessary, for their suppression. They thought, that he
who permitted error to be believed and preached, was
chargeable with a participation in the guilt. Intolerance
became, in their view, a paramount duty to God and to the
heretic himself; and the greater their love of God and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>truth, the greater was their zeal to extirpate, with a strong
hand, every noxious weed from the garden of the Lord.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c010'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
It was not, therefore, a bigoted preference merely for their
own views which made them persecute others, but a conviction
that they only embraced the truth, and that all opposing
doctrines were pernicious, and must not be allowed.
It was not, in their judgment, inconsistent to act thus towards
others, after having themselves endured persecution;
for they regarded themselves as having been sufferers for
the truth, and they were urged, by these very sufferings, to
be more faithful in upholding that truth, and suppressing what
they deemed to be error. It is due to the Pilgrims to remember,
that they acted from principles, erroneous certainly,
and deplorable in their effects, but sincerely adopted and
cherished in hearts which, nevertheless, glowed with love to
God. The grand doctrine of <span class='fss'>LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE</span> was
then a portentous novelty, and it was the glory of Roger
Williams, that he, in such an age, proclaimed it, defended
it, suffered for it, and triumphantly established it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The principles of Roger Williams stood in the attitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>of irreconcilable opposition to the system which
the Pilgrims had established in New-England. They could
not blend with it. They came into collision with it, at
every point. We have accordingly seen, that Mr. Williams
was continually at variance with the government, because
their measures were adjusted to their settled policy, but were
repugnant to his great doctrine. There could be no peace
between them, unless he yielded, or they abandoned their
system. He was firm, and they were unconvinced. They
possessed the power, and they banished him; not so much
to punish him, as to remove from the colony a man whose
doctrines they believed to be wrong, whose influence they
feared, and whom they could neither intimidate nor persuade
to abandon his principles.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is intimated by Dr. Bentley,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c010'><sup>[89]</sup></a> that the rivalry of Salem
and Boston had some effect to induce a rigorous treatment
of Mr. Williams. He had great influence in Salem. He
had drawn thither some persons from Plymouth, and it was,
perhaps, feared, that his popularity gave an importance to
Salem, which might be prejudicial to the metropolis.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is due to the principal actors in these scenes, to record
the fact, of which ample evidence exists, that personal
animosity had little, if any, share in producing the sentence
of banishment. Towards Mr. Williams, as a Christian
and a minister, there was a general sentiment of respect.
Governor Winthrop was a generous friend to him throughout
his life; and it is asserted by Dr. Bentley, that “had
Governor Winthrop been at liberty to concur with Endicott,
and not have been deterred by the competition of Boston
and Salem, Williams would have lived and died at Salem.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Haynes was Governor at the time Mr. Williams was
banished, and Mr. Winthrop lost for a while his salutary
influence over the public councils.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c010'><sup>[90]</sup></a> He endeavored, at a
subsequent period, to procure a repeal of the sentence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>banishment against Mr. Williams; but a more rigid policy
prevailed, and the founder of Rhode-Island continued till
his death an outlaw from Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Cotton was, at that time, the most powerful man in
the commonwealth; and well did his piety, learning and
intrepid love of pure religion merit the respect and affections
of the colonists. Whatever share he may have had in
procuring the banishment of Mr. Williams,<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c010'><sup>[91]</sup></a> it is certain,
that there was no personal feud between them. They had
been acquainted with each other in England, and had alike
suffered from the intolerance of the Prelates. Mr. Cotton
sincerely thought Mr. Williams’ principles wrong, and
dangerous to the church and the state. He felt it to be
the duty of the government to protect the colony, by removing
from it this source of peril. In the controversy which
subsequently arose between Mr. Cotton and Mr. Williams,
the latter uniformly spoke of Mr. Cotton in the most
respectful terms;<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c010'><sup>[92]</sup></a> a circumstance, which is the more
remarkable, because at that day the style of polemic discussion
was less decorous than it is at the present time, and
disputants lavished upon each other, with unsparing
virulence, the bitterest epithets of obloquy. While we
lament, therefore, that a man of so many admirable qualities
as Mr. Cotton, was misled by wrong views of religious
liberty, and thus betrayed into intolerance, we owe it to his
honorable fame to remember, that the best men are imperfect,
and that no personal hostility inflamed his zeal.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may express the verdict, which, at this distant period,
all calm and fair minds will, it is presumed, pronounce:
that Mr. Williams was unnecessarily scrupulous about
some minor points of conduct and of policy, though these
scruples may be candidly traced to the agitated condition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the public mind in England and America, and to his own
delicacy of conscience; that he may have erred in maintaining
his principles with too little of that meek patience
which he who would effect a reform in the opinions of men
must possess, though candor will admit, that the constant
opposition which Mr. Williams encountered might have
irritated a gentler spirit than his; that his behavior to the
civil rulers was not indecorous, unless a firm opposition to
what he considered as wrong in their measures might be
viewed as indecorum, for he yielded to their authority, in
every point which his conscience would allow; that his
private character was pure; and that the cause of his
banishment may be found, in his distinguishing doctrine,
<em>that the civil power has no control over the religious opinions
of men</em>; a doctrine which no man, in our country, would, at
the present day, venture to deny. Mr. Williams was
banished, therefore, because his spirit was too elevated and
enlarged, for the community in which he lived. Like
Aristides, the prominent excellence of his character was
the cause of his banishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the same impartial verdict will do justice to the
Pilgrims. They felt it to be not merely their right, but their
duty, to protect their theocracy from persons, whose
opinions or conduct, in their judgment, disturbed its peace
or endangered its purity. They believed, that the sword
of the magistrate was to be used for the defence of the
church, as in the days of Moses and Aaron. To deny
this principle, was to subvert the foundation of their civil
and religious institutions; and it became, in their opinion,
a measure of self-preservation, and of paramount duty to
God, to expel Mr. Williams from the colony. That the
grounds of this measure were wrong, will not now be
disputed; but we ought to rejoice, that we can ascribe it
to a sincere, though misdirected, desire to uphold the
church, and to advance the honor of God. Were these
excellent men now alive, they would be foremost in lamenting
their own error, and in vindicating those principles of religious
liberty, for which Mr. Williams incurred their displeasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>And we may on this occasion, as on many others, observe
the wonderful wisdom of Divine Providence, which so
controls the mistakes and sins of men, as to accomplish the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>most important results. The banishment of Mr. Williams
contributed in the end to his own happiness and fame.
Another colony was established, and thus civilization and
religion were diffused. And we shall soon see how this
event, though springing from wrong views, and producing
much immediate suffering, was the means, a few years after,
of that interposition of Mr. Williams between the colonists
and the Indians, which apparently rescued the whites
throughout New-England from total destruction.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Numbers, condition, language, rights, &amp;c. of the Indians in New-England.</p>

<p class='c008'>The history of Roger Williams becomes, from this point,
so closely connected with that of the Indians, as to make
it necessary to present a brief sketch of their situation and
character. We must confine our view to those who inhabited
New-England. Mr. Williams himself has furnished
us with valuable aid in this review. His Key to the Indian
Languages, though its chief object was philology, presents
many interesting details respecting the habits and
general character of the aborigines.</p>

<p class='c009'>The territory now comprehended within the limits of
New-England was inhabited by various tribes, the principal
of which were the following:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. The <em>Pawtuckets</em>, whose territory extended from Salem,
(Mass.) to Portsmouth, (N. H.,) being bounded by
the ocean on the east, and by the Nipmuck country on the
west.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The <em>Massachusetts</em>, who dwelt chiefly about the Bay,
which bears their name.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The <em>Pokanokets</em>, who inhabited the territory of the
old colony of Plymouth. This tribe included several subordinate
tribes, among whom were the Wampanoags, the
particular tribe of Massassoit and Philip.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The <em>Narragansets</em>, who inhabited nearly all the territory
which afterwards formed the colony of Rhode-Island,
including the islands in the Bay, Block-Island, and a part
of Long-Island.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The <em>Pequods</em>, who inhabited the southern part of the
present State of Connecticut. The Mohegans have been
considered as a part of this tribe, inhabiting the western
and northern parts of Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c009'>These principal nations included many subordinate and
tributary tribes, among whom may be mentioned the Nipmucks,
who were scattered over the western parts of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>At a period not long preceding the arrival of the
English, a pestilence prevailed among the natives, to so
frightful an extent, that some of the tribes became nearly
extinct. The Pawtuckets, who could previously raise three
thousand fighting men, were almost exterminated. The
Massachusetts, who were equally numerous, were so reduced,
that they could not, probably, in 1630, have raised
a hundred men. The Pokanokets were diminished to
about five hundred warriors.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c010'><sup>[93]</sup></a> The Narragansets suffered
little, and the Pequods were uninjured by the pestilence.
Each of these tribes could raise four thousand fighting
men.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c010'><sup>[94]</sup></a> The Pequods were the most fierce and warlike, and
the Narragansets the most civilized, of the New-England
savages.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Indians, when most numerous, could occupy but a
small portion of the territory. They subsisted chiefly by
hunting, a mode of life which is impracticable except where
extensive tracts remain in the wildness of nature. Their
dwellings were usually built in small villages, rudely constructed
of skins or bark, and easily removed, as their caprice
or necessities required. The lands claimed by each
tribe were held in common. Each member roamed over it at
his pleasure, and took the game wherever he could find it.
Their agriculture was limited to the cultivation of Indian
corn, tobacco, and a few esculent vegetables, such as beans
and squashes. The agricultural labor was performed by
the women, with little skill, and rude implements. The
product must consequently have been small. Game was
not always plentiful, or was consumed with the improvident
voracity of savages. They did not understand the art of
salting provisions for future use. They often suffered from
hunger, especially during the winter. They knew little of
the medical art, and their diseases, though few, were fatal.
Their wars were frequent and sanguinary. Their mode of
life was unfavorable to the rearing of children. For these
and other reasons, the native tribes could never have been
very numerous; and if the Europeans had not landed here,
the country over which our free and flourishing States have
spread themselves would, it is probable, have been, at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>hour, a wilderness, the hunting ground of tribes not less
savage, and, perhaps, little more numerous, than those whom
our fathers found here.</p>

<p class='c009'>The origin of the Indians is involved in impenetrable
mystery. Their own traditions shed no light on the subject,
and nothing has been found, in their customs or languages,
which could lead to a satisfactory conclusion.
Imagination has been active in tracing their connection
with different nations. The favorite theory of many writers
has been, that they are the descendants of the ten Jewish
tribes; but this opinion is founded on the slight ground of
a few coincidences between the customs of the Jews and
those of the Indians, and fancied resemblances in some of
their words to terms in the Hebrew language. Roger Williams
wisely refrains from expressing any opinion on the
subject, except by stating his confidence that the Indians
have sprung from Adam and Noah. He mentions several
Indian customs, which resemble Jewish rites, and says,
“others (and myself) have conceived some of their words
to hold affinity with the Hebrew.” But he adds, “I have
found a greater affinity of their language with the Greek
tongue.”<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c010'><sup>[95]</sup></a> The natives themselves believed, that their
great god Cautantowit made a man and woman of a stone,
but disliking them, he broke them in pieces, and made
another man and woman of a tree, from whom all mankind
have descended.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c010'><sup>[96]</sup></a> The mounds and other monuments
found in the western States, have been considered as evidences,
that some people, superior to the Indians, once inhabited
that part of the country. But who they were, and
why they disappeared, we shall probably never know. The
probability seems to be, that America was first inhabited
by emigrants from Asia, who crossed from the one continent
to the other, at some point near the northwestern extremity
of America. But conjecture is useless. That the
Indians have descended from Adam, no one who reverences
the Bible will doubt. That they are of a kindred nature
with other men is proved, both by their virtues and their
vices. Their minds are acknowledged, by all who have
known them well, to be fully equal in strength and acuteness
to those of civilized men. That they are capable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>becoming pious Christians, has happily been demonstrated
by many cheering examples.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their government was very simple. A wild freedom
prevailed among them, and their roving habits did not permit
much control. They needed, however, some rulers in
peace, and leaders in war. Each tribe had one or more
chiefs, called sachems, who were, at first, chosen by the
tribe, or who gained the ascendency, by superior wisdom
or courage. Some of these sachems inherited and transmitted
their power, by hereditary right; but it is probable,
that the incumbent owed his authority more to his personal
qualities than to his birth.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c010'><sup>[97]</sup></a> The sachems held nominally
the supreme power, and received tribute, but they were
controlled by the wisdom of the aged men, and by the fierce
energy of the young warriors. “The sachems,” says
Roger Williams,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c010'><sup>[98]</sup></a> “although they have an absolute monarchy
over the people, yet they will not conclude of aught
that concerns all, either laws, or subsidies, or wars, unto
which the people are averse, and by gentle persuasion cannot
be brought.” There were subordinate chiefs, sometimes
called sagamores, who held a limited authority over
portions of the tribes. All important questions were discussed
in councils, where eloquence was as fervid and
efficacious, probably, as in the more polished assemblies of
Greece.</p>

<p class='c009'>The physical characteristics of the Indians were common
to all the tribes,—a bronze or copper color; straight, coarse,
black hair, hazel eyes, high cheek bones, and an erect form.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c010'><sup>[99]</sup></a>
They possessed firm, well compacted bodies, capable of
enduring the greatest hardships and fatigues, and regardless
of cold, while travelling in the severity of winter.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c010'><sup>[100]</sup></a> They
were very active, and could run vast distances with astonishing
speed and endurance.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c010'><sup>[101]</sup></a> They could subsist for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>many days on a little parched corn, pounded into meal.
“This,” says Roger Williams, “is a very wholesome food,
which they eat with a little water, hot or cold. I have travelled
with near two hundred of them at once, near one hundred
miles through the woods, each man carrying a little
basket of this at his back, and sometimes in a hollow leather
girdle about his middle, sufficient for a man for three or four
days. With this ready provision, and their bow and arrow,
are they ready for war and travel at a moment’s warning.
With a spoonful of this meal and a spoonful of water from
the brook, have I made many a good dinner and supper.”<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c010'><sup>[102]</sup></a>
When they had leisure, however, and a plentiful supply of
food, they would compensate themselves for their abstinence,
by eating enormous quantities. Their cookery was
simple, their meat or fish being boiled or roasted, and eaten
without salt or bread. Indian corn, boiled, either whole or
when ground, was a common dish.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c010'><sup>[103]</sup></a> Their only drink was
water, until Europeans introduced among them the devouring
curse of spirituous liquors. Tobacco was in general
use, as a remedy for the toothache, and as a stimulant, of
which they were as fond as their civilized successors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their diseases were few, but neglect or injudicious treatment
made them very destructive. The chief remedy was
sweating, in a cave or cell, made hot with heated stones.
In this cell the patient remained an hour or more, and then
plunged into a river. Roger Williams expended much
time and money in administering to the sick among the
Indians, and he expressed his confidence, that millions of
the natives had perished for want of suitable aid. Infectious
diseases sometimes seized them, and made terrific
ravages. The living fled, and whole towns were deserted.
The powaws, or priests, pretended to much skill in curing
diseases; but their medical practice consisted mainly of
hideous bellowings, incantations, and other fantastic ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Their domestic habits were not favorable to happiness or
virtue. The marriage relation was formed with little care,
and was dissolved at the pleasure of the husband. A man
might have as many wives as he chose, and was able to purchase
from their parents. The women were treated with
rigor. They were forced to perform the labors of agriculture,
and to carry the provisions and packs of every kind,
in their huntings and marches. The parents permitted
their children to grow up without restraint, and the children
were undutiful, and often cruel to their parents.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Indians were hospitable to strangers. They were
grateful for benefits, and were firm friends; but their resentment
of injuries was fierce and implacable. They
pursued an enemy with the malignity of fiends, and they
usually murdered their captives, with prolonged and shocking
tortures. They met death, even when thus inflicted,
with the utmost composure, disdaining to exhibit any
symptoms of fear or pain, and often provoking their tormentors
by scornful taunts. They were treacherous, prone
to lying, and indolent, except when war or hunting roused
them to action. They were fond of sports, and like the
Germans, as described by Tacitus, they were addicted to
gaming.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had no commerce, except the sale of corn, skins,
and some other articles, to the Europeans. Their only
money consisted of shells, sewed together on strips of cloth,
and thus forming belts of various lengths, and different degrees
of beauty, according to the taste of the maker. This
money, as described by Roger Williams, “was of two sorts:
one white, which they make of the stem or stock of the
periwinkle, which they call meteauhock, when all the shell
is broken off; and of this sort, six of their small beads
(which they make with holes to string the bracelets) are
current with the English for a penny. The second is
black, inclining to blue, which is made of the shell of a fish
which the English call hens, poquauhock,<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c010'><sup>[104]</sup></a> and of this sort
three make an English penny.” The white money was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>called wampum, which signified white. The other was
called suckauhock, a word signifying black. Both kinds
seem to have been called wampum, or wampumpeag. The
Narraganset Indians were reputed the most skilful coiners
of wampum, and the most ingenious manufacturers of pendants,
bracelets, stone tobacco pipes, and earthen vessels
for cooking and other domestic uses.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c010'><sup>[105]</sup></a> They were, as a
cause, or perhaps as a consequence, more civilized and less
warlike than their neighbors.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c010'><sup>[106]</sup></a> The Pequods insulted them,
with the contemptuous title of a nation of women. It is a
coincidence worthy of remark, that Rhode-Island, where
this primitive nation of manufacturers resided, is distinguished
as the place where the manufacture of cotton was
commenced in this country, and where this, and its kindred
arts, have been cultivated with great success. The
history of Rhode-Island, however, shows that her sons have
not been deficient in martial qualities. If the sarcasm of
the Pequods was deserved by the Narragansets, it has no
application to those who now occupy the beautiful islands,
the streams, the hills and the plains, from which this hapless
tribe have disappeared forever.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wars of the Indians were frequent. They were
conducted in a desultory manner, with all the arts of savage
cunning. Their weapons were bows and arrows, clubs,
and rude spears. Their arrows were headed with sharp,
triangular pieces of stone, many of which are found at the
present day. After the arrival of the English, the arrow
heads were made of brass, and an iron hatchet being added
to the club, formed the dreaded tomahawk. The Indians
soon learned the value of fire arms. Though the sale of
muskets and of powder to the Indians was forbidden by the
colonists, yet the natives, obtaining a supply from the Dutch,
and from unprincipled traders, speedily rivalled the Europeans
in the skilful use of these instruments of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>The religion of the Indians was vague and shadowy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>They had no images, but they worshipped a number of
deities. Roger Williams said, that he had heard the names
of thirty-seven gods, to whom they rendered some religious
homage. They acknowledged, however, one superior being,
named Cautantowit, as the creator of men, and the
giver of their corn and other temporal benefits. They believed
that Cautantowit resided in the southwest,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c010'><sup>[107]</sup></a> in a delightful
region, to which the souls of good men went after
death, and enjoyed fruitful fields, placid streams, abundant
game, and every thing else which an Indian’s imagination
could conceive as necessary to happiness. The souls of
wicked men, as they believed, would wander, without rest.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c010'><sup>[108]</sup></a>
The separate existence and immortality of the soul, and an
endless state of retribution, according to the deeds done in
the body, were prominent doctrines in the narrow creed of
these rude savages. These doctrines are found among
almost all nations; and their prevalence can be satisfactorily
explained only by supposing that they are derived from
the original revelation, and preserved, by tradition, as well as
by their accordance with the reason and instincts of mankind.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Indians had priests, who directed their worship.
This consisted in little more than occasional prayers, dances
and feasts. Their religion had little influence over their
minds, as an incentive to virtue, or as a source of consolation.
They lived in gross darkness, and died without hope.
Though Eliot, Roger Williams, and others, labored for
their spiritual welfare, with some success,<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c010'><sup>[109]</sup></a> yet the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>mass of the tribes went into eternity without a knowledge
of the Saviour. It is melancholy to reflect, that multitudes
of these immortal beings died, in all their darkness, after
the glorious Gospel had begun to shed its radiance over
these hills and vallies. Our fathers desired and attempted
their conversion, but their efforts were baffled, by many adverse
causes. Let us, at this late day, endeavor to lead
the feeble remnants of these departed nations to the great
Bishop of souls.</p>

<p class='c009'>The languages of the Indians are among the wonders of
philology. They have been studied, with ardor and success,
by many scholars in our own country, and by a few
scientific men abroad.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c010'><sup>[110]</sup></a> These languages, instead of being
rude and scanty, as might be inferred from the character of
the Indians, are found to be astonishingly regular and copious,
rich in forms, and possessing a facility of combination,
and a nice discrimination in their inflections, which
are scarcely surpassed even by the ancient Greek.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c010'><sup>[111]</sup></a> Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Du Ponceau, of Philadelphia, who has studied the native
dialects with great diligence and with philosophical acumen,
says, “I confess that I am lost in astonishment at the copiousness
and admirable structure of their languages; for
which I can only account by looking up to the Great First
Cause.”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c010'><sup>[112]</sup></a> He says, of the Delaware language, “it would
rather appear to have been formed by philosophers in their
closets, than by savages in the wilderness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The languages and dialects spoken on the continent of
America, have been estimated by the authors of the Mithridates,
at the astonishing number of <em>twelve hundred and
fourteen</em>.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c010'><sup>[113]</sup></a> A large proportion of these, however, are only
variations of a few parent languages, just as the English
language is varied in different counties in England by peculiarities,
which are scarcely intelligible in other parts of the
island. The French language is, in the same way, corrupted
by the <em>patois</em> of different sections of the country.
Unwritten languages are, of course, still more liable to variations,
which, in time, would make a distinct dialect.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the native languages of North America have been
reduced to four classes: 1. The Karalit, or language of
Greenland, and the Esquimaux. 2. The Delaware. 3.
The Iroquois. 4. The Floridian, comprehending the body
of languages spoken on the whole southern frontier of the
United States.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c010'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The dialects spoken in New-England are believed to have
been varieties of the Delaware language.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c010'><sup>[115]</sup></a> Roger Williams
affirms of the Narraganset tongue, that “with this I have
entered into the secrets of those countries wherever English
dwell, about two hundred miles, between the French
and Dutch plantations. There is a mixture of this language
north and south from the place of my abode about six
hundred miles; yet, within the two hundred miles aforesaid,
their dialects do exceedingly differ, yet not so but (within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>that compass) a man may by this help converse with thousands
of natives all over the country.”<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c010'><sup>[116]</sup></a> The Massachusetts
language, into which Eliot translated the Bible, was radically
the same tongue as the Narraganset.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger Williams published the first vocabulary of an Indian
language. His book attracted attention, when first
published, in 1643, and it is still much valued. We shall have
occasion to recur to it. Eliot wrote a Grammar of the Massachusetts
language. The son of President Edwards wrote
a brief account of the Mohegan language. The Hon. Josiah
Cotton, a descendant of the great John Cotton, compiled a
vocabulary of the Massachusetts dialect. These and other
valuable papers on the native languages, have been published
in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical
Society. They are worthy of the attention of every man
who loves to study the human mind, and who feels an
interest in the character of the Indians.</p>

<p class='c009'>We will now offer a few remarks on a subject which has
already been touched, the rights of the Indians, and the
treatment which they received from the colonists. It is a
topic of deep interest, which affects the character of our
fathers, and to which recent events and the present condition
of the surviving Indians have attracted earnest attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>The right of the natives to hold the possession and control
of all the territory on this continent has been a subject of
dispute. The general principles applicable to this case, as
expounded by Vattel, are these:<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c010'><sup>[117]</sup></a> God has given the earth
to the human race, and every man is entitled to a portion
of its surface, sufficient for the comfortable support of himself
and family. The actual occupancy of such a portion
gives to the occupant a title which no man can rightfully
disturb. But no one has an original right to appropriate
to himself more than he needs, because he may thus deprive
others, who possess equal rights with himself, of their
appropriate share. Nor can he justly adopt a mode of
subsistence, which will necessarily require so large an extent
of territory, as to deprive his fellow men of their proportion,
and either prevent the increase of the human race,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>or produce in other places an accumulation of masses of
men, too great to be comfortably sustained. That the
cultivation of the earth was designed by the Creator to be
the chief means of subsistence to the human family, cannot
be doubted; because the increase of the race was certainly
his purpose,<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c010'><sup>[118]</sup></a> and agriculture is the only mode by
which a dense population could every where be supported.
It follows, that a man has no right to claim for himself a
vast tract of forest, because he chooses to subsist by hunting.
If all other men cannot have a similar tract, he must,
himself, become a cultivator, and thus subsist on a small
portion of land. If a man had appropriated to himself a
large territory, which, by proper cultivation, would furnish
subsistence for many others, those others, if their necessities
required, would have a right to claim their share, and
to enforce their claim.</p>

<p class='c009'>These principles, in their application to a primitive society,
just taking possession of a new territory, seem to be
indisputable. They are the principles on which the land
of Canaan was divided among the Jews, by the authority
of God himself, and on which the colonists in this country
generally proceeded, in dividing the territory which they
acquired from the Indians.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the progress of society, however, the balance soon
becomes disturbed. Other modes of subsistence than agriculture
are adopted, and various causes produce an accumulation
of wealth in the hands of some men, while others
are reduced to indigence. The peace of society requires,
that the rich should be protected in their lawful possessions;
though every civilized nation still acts on the principle,
that every member of the community is entitled to
a subsistence. He ought to earn it by his labor, but if
sickness, or want of employment, or other reasonable
causes, prevent, he is entitled to assistance from the community,
and the rich are taxed for his support. The most
strenuous opposer of poor laws will not deny, that a man,
who cannot maintain himself, has a right to aid from his
fellow citizens. Thus the original law of nature comes
into operation, and the inequalities which arise are, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>some measure, compensated. But a fundamental principle
of civilized society is, that every man is to be protected
in the enjoyment of the property which he lawfully acquires.
He may use it as he pleases, if he does not injure
others; and he cannot be deprived of it, or of any part of
it, without his own consent.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not easy to see, why the same principle should not
be applied to the Indians. They had regular, though simple,
governments, and the territories of each tribe were
defined by boundaries sufficiently precise for their purposes.
They had the best of all titles to their lands, actual
possession. Why, then, might not the Indian claim to be
protected in the enjoyment of his property? Why might he
not make use of that property as he pleased, while he did
not trespass on the rights of others? If the law of nations
did not reach him, was he out of the pale of the great law
of justice and reason? If it were said, that he had no
right to appropriate to himself miles of forest, for a hunting
ground, he might reply, that he had as good a right as an
English nobleman has to appropriate to himself a vast
space, for parks and fish ponds; and, indeed, a better
right, by the law of nature, for every other Indian could
enjoy as much land as himself, while the nobleman must
see hundreds around him in abject poverty.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it has been said, that the Creator could not have
designed this vast and beautiful region to be exclusively
inhabited by a few thousands of savage hunters; and, therefore,
if the old world should become crowded with inhabitants,
a portion of them would have a right to remove to
America, and occupy a portion of it, as a part of the great
inheritance of the human race. The Indians would consequently
be bound to allow them a sufficient space; and
if the numbers of both parties should so increase as to
make hunting impracticable, the Indians ought to become
cultivators.</p>

<p class='c009'>If this theory were admitted as sound, the practical application
of it would not be easy. The absolute necessity
of emigration from the old world has not, perhaps, occurred,
and yet this case must be made out, to justify an occupancy
of a part of the Indian territory, without the consent of the
natives. Immense tracts of uncultivated land exist in
Europe, and even in England. Why would it not be as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>just for a company of settlers to fix their dwellings in a nobleman’s
park, cut down his trees, and plant their corn, as
to do the same on the lands of an Indian? If it were alleged,
that the Indian had more land than he needed, the
same might be said, perhaps, of the nobleman. At any
rate, it might be asked, who was the proper judge, how
much land an Indian needed?</p>

<p class='c009'>But, looking at the actual state of things, at the settlement
of this country, the necessities of the Pilgrims were
sufficiently great, to make it the duty of the Indians to receive
them hospitably, and allow them a portion of their
lands. Where the country was deserted by the natives, the
colonists might, undoubtedly, take possession. But wherever
the Indians actually occupied the territory, even for the
purposes of hunting, they were, clearly, the proprietors;
and though it was doubtless their duty to cede to the Europeans
a sufficient portion for their maintenance, yet they
could not justly be forced to perform this duty. The settlers
were bound to be satisfied with a sufficient amount of land
for their comfortable support by agriculture and by the
arts of civilized life. But the Indians retained an inviolable
right to so much territory as they deemed necessary for
their own use. Their title was beyond dispute. No power
on earth could lawfully dispossess them.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may conclude, then, that the Indians were the lawful
proprietors of all the lands which they occupied. They
were independent nations, and had a right to regulate
their governments, and use their territory, as they pleased,
while they respected the rights of others. They consequently
could not be lawfully subjected to the sway of
any other nation, without their own consent. No charters
from popes or kings could give a right to take possession
of the Indian territory. The Indians were nevertheless
under an obligation to receive distressed Europeans, who
sought their coasts, and to sell them land. They were,
too, bound by the great law of God, which requires men to
aspire after moral and physical perfection. This law
obliged them to become civilized, and to adopt those modes
of life which would enable their territory to support the
greatest possible number of inhabitants. Hence arose
another obligation to admit Europeans among them, who
were capable of instructing and elevating them to the rank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>of civilized, educated, Christian nations. The duties of
the settlers were, to make a reasonable compensation for
the land ceded; to respect the rights of the natives; to
treat them with uniform kindness; to teach them the arts
of civilization; and, above all, to inculcate the principles
and the practice of the Christian religion.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is pleasing to observe, in the history of the New-England
colonists, that the duties of both parties were, to
so great an extent, fulfilled. The Indians, in most cases,
received the white men with generous hospitality; they
sold them land, on easy terms; many tribes remained their
firm friends; and some of the natives became converts to
the Christian faith. The colonists, on the other hand,
purchased their lands from the Indians, for such a compensation
as satisfied the natives, and was a fair equivalent
at that time.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c010'><sup>[119]</sup></a> They treated the Indians, generally, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>justice, and they made many zealous efforts for their conversion.
That some of the proceedings of the colonists
towards the Indians were not strictly equitable nor kind,
must be admitted. Our fathers were too prone to view
them rather as heathens than as men. They recurred too
often to the Jewish history, for imaginary analogies; and
drew unauthorized inferences from the conduct of the
Jews towards idolatrous nations, whom God, the sovereign
ruler, commanded them to destroy. In their wars with
the natives, the colonists were sometimes unjustifiably
severe; but it is due to their memory to say, that those
wars were commenced by the savages themselves, from
jealousy of the advancing power of the whites, rather than
from the experience of actual injury. We must consider,
too, that when the struggle came, it was, on the part of
the whites, a contest for life and death, with an enemy
vastly more numerous, and whose modes of warfare were
treacherous, cruel, and terrific in the highest degree to the
scattered and feeble settlements.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c010'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>A candid reader of our early colonial history, while he
observes many things which he deeply regrets and condemns,
must nevertheless admit, that the conduct of our
fathers towards the Indians was, in general, worthy of
their high character, as wise and pious, yet imperfect men,
who were placed in circumstances which severely tried
their principles, and amid difficulties, which required the
utmost wisdom and courage. When we consider the diabolical
cruelty with which the Spaniards treated the unhappy
natives of South America, we must turn, with, emotions
of grateful pleasure, to the history of our own land,
and rejoice, that our fathers were men, for whom their descendants
have little occasion to blush, or to apologize.</p>

<p class='c009'>The kings of England, whatever language they employed
in their patents and charters, treated the Indians,
in practice, as separate nations, and entered into treaties
with different tribes. The government of the United
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>States have done the same, and, except in one humiliating
instance, have pursued towards the natives a just and
humane policy. The treaties so formed have been pronounced,
by the highest legal authority in this country,
to be binding on our government, and the rights of the
Indians, as distinct nations, though under the protection of
the United States, have thus been judicially recognised.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c010'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>That the Indian tribes in New-England melted away,
must awaken melancholy feelings. But it cannot be maintained,
that their disappearance was occasioned mainly by
the treatment or the neglect which they experienced from
the colonial governments. These governments could not
wholly prevent unprincipled individuals from inflicting
wrongs on the natives, which tended to exasperate them.
They could not entirely exclude the introduction of ardent
spirits, the most deadly and active agent in the destruction
of the aborigines. Though they sent missionaries, and
printed Bibles, and erected schools, for the religious and
literary instruction of the natives, they could not reclaim
any considerable proportion of them from their savage
habits. As the whites increased, the game disappeared,
and as the Indians did not alter their habits, they became
destitute, and their numbers diminished. They saw, at
length, the alternative, of utter ruin or the expulsion of the
English, and they determined to attempt the latter. But
it was too late. They fought, with desperation, and filled
the land with frightful distress and bloodshed. But the
superior skill of the whites prevailed, and the death of the
formidable Philip terminated forever the power of the Indians
in New-England. We may admit, that the savages
were impelled by some motives of patriotism and love of
liberty. We may respect and pity them. But surely we
cannot lament that they failed; that their exterminating
warfare did not accomplish its purpose; that the tomahawk
did not, after butchering the last father in the field, smite
the last infant in the cradle; that the flames did not lay in
ashes every dwelling of civilized man and every temple of
God; and that barbarism did not resume its dominion over
the hills and vallies of New-England. No man, if he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>do it by waving some potent wand, would bid all this
teeming population, this wide spread happiness, this wonderful
triumph of civilization, freedom and religion, disappear,
like a gorgeous vision, and restore this whole land to
the condition in which the Pilgrims found it, or even place
it in the situation in which it would have been, at this moment,
if no civilized man had landed on these shores.
Human happiness has been immeasurably increased by the
settlement of this continent. Christianity has extended
her conquests; and no thoughtful man can doubt, that the
landing of the Pilgrims, and the subsequent history of this
country, have been controlled by Him, who accomplishes
his great designs of mercy to the universe, by means which
often involve individual suffering, and sometimes produce
national ruin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us feel our obligation to treat the feeble remnants of
the tribes who yet remain with generous kindness. Let us
recompense them for whatever wrongs their fathers may
have received. Let us, now that they are weak, and we
are strong, be scrupulously attentive to their rights, and
seek to promote their highest temporal and eternal welfare.
Without the friendship of their fathers, at the beginning,
ours must have perished. Let the children of the white
man prove their gratitude, by saving from ruin the helpless
descendants of the savage.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Williams proceeds to Seekonk—crosses the river, and founds the
town of Providence.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the middle of January, 1635–6,<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c010'><sup>[122]</sup></a> Mr. Williams
left Salem, in secrecy and haste. It is not certain, that
any one accompanied him, though a number of persons
were with him a short time afterwards. He proceeded to
the south, towards the Narraganset Bay. The weather
was very severe, and his sufferings were great. In a letter
written thirty-five years afterwards, he said: “I was sorely
tossed for one fourteen weeks, in a bitter winter season, not
knowing what bread or bed did mean;” and he added, that
he still felt the effects of his exposure to the severity of the
weather.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c010'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>He appears to have visited Ousamequin, the sachem of
Pokanoket, who resided at Mount Hope, near the present
town of Bristol (R. I.) From him he obtained a grant of
land now included in the town of Seekonk, in Massachusetts,
on the east bank of Pawtucket (now Seekonk) river.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c010'><sup>[124]</sup></a>
This territory was within the limits of the Plymouth colony,
but Mr. Williams recognised the Indians only as the proprietors,
and bought a title from the sachem. Ousamequin
doubtless granted his request with pleasure, as a return for
the services and presents which he had formerly received
from Mr. Williams. If, as we have supposed, the exile
was obliged to visit the sachem, and make these arrangements,
the journey, on foot, increased that exposure to the
severity of the elements, of which he complains.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was, moreover, unprovided with a dwelling. Mr.
Cotton (in his Bloody Tenet washed, p. 8.) says, “that
some of his friends went to the place appointed by himself
beforehand, to make provision of housing, and other necessaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>for him against his coming.” This statement
however, must be incorrect. Mr. Williams’ departure from
Salem was sudden and unexpected; and his assertion,
just quoted, that he did not know “what bread or bed
did mean,” for fourteen weeks, must be understood as
excluding the idea of such a preparation as Mr. Cotton
mentions. Mr. Williams, too, says, “I first pitched, and
began to build and plant at Seekonk.”<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c010'><sup>[125]</sup></a> He had no house,
it would seem, till he built one.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the means of subsistence, he must have been dependent
on the Indians. At that season, hunting and fishing
were impracticable, if he had possessed the proper instruments.
The earth was covered with snow, and he had not
even the poor resource of roots. He may refer to his
situation at this time, in the following lines, alluding to the
Indians:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“God’s Providence is rich to his,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Let none distrustful be;</div>
      <div class='line'>In wilderness, in great distress,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These ravens have fed me.”<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c010'><sup>[126]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The spot, in Seekonk, where he reared his habitation,
is believed, on good authority, to have been at Manton’s
Neck, near the cove, a short distance above the Central
Bridge.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c010'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Here he probably hoped, that he might live in peace.
He was soon joined by several friends, if they did not at
first accompany him. His wife and children were still at
Salem.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Seekonk was not to be his home. In a short time,
to use his own language, “I received a letter from my
ancient friend, Mr. Winslow, the Governor of Plymouth,
professing his own and others’ love and respect to me, yet
lovingly advising me, since I was fallen into the edge of
their bounds, and they were loath to displease the Bay, to
remove to the other side of the water, and there, he said, I
had the country free before me, and might be as free as
themselves, and we should be loving neighbors together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This advice was apparently prudent and friendly, prompted
by a desire of peace, and by a kind regard to Mr. Williams.
It does not seem to deserve the harsh comments which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>have sometimes been made on it. Mr. Williams himself
does not speak of it in a tone of reproach. He immediately
resolved to comply with the advice. He accordingly
embarked in a canoe, with five others,<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c010'><sup>[128]</sup></a> and proceeded
down the stream. As they approached the little cove, near
Tockwotten, now India Point, they were saluted, by a
company of Indians, with the friendly interrogation, “<em>What
cheer?</em>” a common English phrase, which they had learned
from the colonists.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c010'><sup>[129]</sup></a> At this spot, they probably went on
shore, but they did not long remain there.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c010'><sup>[130]</sup></a> They passed
round India Point and Fox Point, and proceeded up the
river on the west side of the peninsula, to a spot near the
mouth of the Moshassuck river. Tradition reports, that
Mr. Williams landed near a spring, which remains till this
day.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c010'><sup>[131]</sup></a> At this spot, the settlement of Rhode-Island commenced:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

      <div class='line'>“O call it holy ground,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The soil where first they trod,</div>
      <div class='line'>They have left unstained, what there they found,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To the town here founded, Mr. Williams, with his habitual
piety, and in grateful remembrance of “God’s merciful
Providence to him in his distress,” gave the name of
<span class='sc'>Providence</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>There has been much discussion respecting the precise
period at which this memorable event occurred. There is
a perplexing confusion in the statements of different writers.
We shall be excused, if we examine the subject with some
minuteness. Callender, in his Century Sermon, (p. 18)
says, that it was “in the spring of the year 1634–5.”
Governor Hopkins, in his History of Providence,<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c010'><sup>[133]</sup></a> places it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“some time in the year 1634.” Hutchinson (vol. i. p. 41)
assigns the same year. Later writers have naturally been
led into the same mistake. Backus (vol. i. p. 70) states,
that in January, 1636, Mr. Williams left Massachusetts,
which is the right date, according to the modern mode of
computing time, though, by the style, which then prevailed,
it was 1635.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the period of his banishment is fixed decisively by the
records of Massachusetts, and by Winthrop’s Journal.
His sentence of banishment was passed, November 3,
1635.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c010'><sup>[134]</sup></a> In January following, according to Winthrop (vol.
i. p. 175) the Court resolved to send him to England, and
the messengers found, that he had departed from Salem
three days before their arrival.</p>

<p class='c009'>In his letter to Major Mason, Mr. Williams says, “The
next year after my banishment, the Lord drew the bow of
the Pequod war against the country.” This war commenced
in July, 1636, with the murder of Oldham. This fact
corroborates the preceding statement.</p>

<p class='c009'>The time of his leaving Seekonk for Providence cannot
be accurately determined, but we may approach very near
to the true date.</p>

<p class='c009'>Governor Winslow, of Plymouth, who advised him to leave
Seekonk, entered on his official duties in March, 1635–6.
This was the only year that he held the office of Governor,
between 1633 and 1644.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c010'><sup>[135]</sup></a> Mr. Williams must, therefore,
have been at Seekonk, subsequently to the date of Governor
Winslow’s accession to office.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Mr. Williams’ letter to Major Mason, he says, that
he “began to build and plant at Seekonk.” He did not
begin to plant, we may presume, till the middle of April, if
so early.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c010'><sup>[136]</sup></a> In the same letter, he speaks of his removal as
occasioning his “loss of a harvest that year,” from which
remark we may reasonably infer, that the corn had attained
a considerable growth before he left Seekonk, and consequently
that he did not cross the river till the middle, perhaps,
of June.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 26th of July, a letter was received from Mr.
Williams, by Governor Vane, informing him of the murder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>of Mr. Oldham, by the Indians of Block-Island.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c010'><sup>[137]</sup></a> This
letter was written at Providence, and it proves, that Mr.
Williams had removed thither previously to the 26th of
July.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may safely conclude, that he left Seekonk, not far
from the middle of June, 1636. The exact day will never,
it is probable, be ascertained.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c010'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>There is one circumstance, which, perhaps, misled Mr.
Callender and Governor Hopkins respecting the year of
Mr. Williams’ arrival. In a deed, signed by himself and
wife, and dated December 20, 1661, he used these words:
“Having, in the year one thousand six hundred thirty-four,
and in the year one thousand six hundred thirty-five, had
several treaties with Canonicus and Miantinomo, the two
chief sachems of the Narragansets, and in the end purchased
of them the lands and meadows upon the two fresh rivers,
called Moshassuck and Wanasquatucket, the two sachems
having, by a deed under their hands, two years after the
sale thereof, established and confirmed the bounds of these
lands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The statement, that he had held several treaties with the
Narraganset sachems, in 1634 and 1635, presents some
difficulty. But we have already seen, that while at
Plymouth and at Salem, he held some intercourse with
these chiefs. In a manuscript letter, already quoted, he
says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I spared no cost towards them, and in gifts to
Ousamequin and all his, and to Canonicus and all his,
tokens and presents, many years before I came in person
to the Narraganset; and therefore when I came, I was
welcome to Ousamequin and to the old prince Canonicus,
who was most shy of all English to his last breath.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is probable, therefore, that the “treaties” which he
mentions, as having been held in 1634 and 1635, were
propositions concerning lands, made by him, perhaps, to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>chiefs, through Indians, whom he saw at Boston or Salem,
and by whom he was in the habit of sending to them
presents. We have already intimated a conjecture, that
for some time before his banishment, he had entertained
the thought of a settlement in the Indian country. If so,
it was natural for him to enter into negotiations for lands.
But these propositions, whatever they were, were not
concluded in the years which he mentions. He says, that
“<em>in the end</em>,” he purchased the lands at Providence, and
that the deed was dated two years after the purchase.
We accordingly find, that the deed was dated “at
Narraganset, the 24th of the first month, commonly
called March, in the second year of the plantation, or
planting at Moshassuck, or Providence.” The year is not
mentioned in the instrument, but it is known to have been
1637–8.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c010'><sup>[139]</sup></a> This deed corresponds with Mr. Williams’
statement, and refers to the year 1636 as the time of his
actual purchase, and also as that of his arrival.</p>

<p class='c009'>We will add another fact, to strengthen a position, which
has, perhaps, been sufficiently established. A parchment
deed, now in the possession of Moses Brown, is dated the
“14th day of the second month, in the 5th year of our
situation, or plantation, at Moshassuck, or Providence, and
in the 17th year of King Charles, &amp;c. 1641.”<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c010'><sup>[140]</sup></a> This deed
also points to the year 1636, as the date of the first settlement
of Providence.</p>

<p class='c009'>In June, of this year, the settlement of Hartford (Con.)
was begun. Rev. Messrs. Hooker and Stone, who had
been settled at Newtown, (now Cambridge) removed, with
their whole church, and founded the city of Hartford. A
fort had been built, the preceding year, at Saybrook, at the
mouth of the river Connecticut, and small settlements
had been commenced at Weathersfield and Windsor.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Purchase of lands from the Indians—division of the lands among
the settlers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spot where Mr. Williams and his companions
landed was within the jurisdiction of the Narraganset
Indians.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c010'><sup>[141]</sup></a> The sachems of this tribe were Canonicus,
and his nephew Miantinomo. The former was an old
man, and he probably associated with him his young
nephew, as better fitted to sustain the toils and cares of
royalty. Their residence is said by Gookin to have been
about Narraganset Bay, and on the island of Canonicut.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first object of Mr. Williams would naturally be, to
obtain from the sachems a grant of land for his new
colony. He probably visited them, and received a verbal
cession of the territory, which, two years afterwards, was
formally conveyed to him by a deed. This instrument
may properly be quoted here:<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c010'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“At Narraganset, the 24th of the first month, commonly
called March, the second year of the plantation or
planting at Moshassuck, or Providence; Memorandum,
that we, Canonicus and Miantinomo, the two chief sachems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of Narraganset, having two years since sold unto Roger
Williams the lands and meadows upon the two fresh rivers,
called Moshassuck and Wanasquatucket, do now, by these
presents, establish and confirm the bounds of these lands,
from the river and fields of Pawtucket, the great hill of
Notaquoncanot, on the northwest, and the town of Mashapaug,
on the west.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c010'><sup>[143]</sup></a> We also, in consideration of the
many kindnesses and services he hath continually done
for us, both with our friends of Massachusetts, as also at
Connecticut, and Apaum, or Plymouth, we do freely give
unto him all that land from those rivers reaching to Pawtuxet
river; as also the grass and meadows upon the
said Pawtuxet river. In witness whereof, we have hereunto
set our hands.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The lands thus ceded to Mr. Williams he conveyed to
twelve men, who accompanied, or soon joined, him, reserving
for himself an equal part only. Before we narrate
the particulars of this transaction, a few remarks are
necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>It appears from the tenor of the deed, and from other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>evidence, that the original sale included only the lands
mentioned in the first part of the deed. These are said
by the sachems to have been “sold” to Mr. Williams.
The grass and meadows on Pawtuxet river are said to be
given to him, in consideration of his services.</p>

<p class='c009'>An interesting question, which occasioned much debate
in the early times of the colony, claims consideration
here. Were the lands, ceded by the sachems, so conveyed,
that they became the property of Roger Williams
himself, and might he, with justice and honor, have sold
or retained them, as he pleased? An answer to this question
will throw light on his subsequent conduct.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conveyance in the deed is made to him alone.
The title, consequently, was vested in him, so far as the
instrument went. But this fact does not decide the point.
It was a subject of accusation against him, that the conveyance
was not made to him and <em>his associates</em>. Did he,
then, act on behalf of others, as well as for himself?</p>

<p class='c009'>If his own solemn and often repeated assertions are
worthy of credit, he obtained the lands by his own money
and influence, and might have held them as his property.</p>

<p class='c009'>He argues the case at large, in his letter to the Commissioners,
in 1677, to whom he was accused of unfair
conduct respecting the lands.</p>

<p class='c009'>He asserts, in the first place, “It is not true, that I
was employed by any, was supplied by any, or desired any
to come with me into these parts. My soul’s desire was,
to do the natives good, and to that end to learn their language,
(which I afterwards printed) and therefore desired
not to be troubled with English company.” He adds,
that “out of pity, he gave leave to several persons to
come along in his company.” He makes the same statement
in his deed of 1661:—“I desired it might be for a
shelter for persons distressed for conscience. I then considering
the condition of divers of my distressed countrymen,
I communicated my said purchase unto my loving
friends, [whom he names] who then desired to take shelter
here with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It seems, then, that his original design was to come
alone, probably to dwell among the Indians, and do them
good; but he altered his plan, and resolved to establish a
refuge for those who might flee from persecution. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>project was his own, and worthy of his generous and liberal
mind. He certainly was not employed, as an agent,
to purchase lands for others. He uses another argument:
“I mortgaged my house in Salem (worth some hundreds)
for supplies to go through, and, therefore, was it a single
business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus shown that he acted for himself, and on
his own responsibility, he states, that the lands were procured
from the sachems by his influence alone. He enumerates
several advantages which he enjoyed in this
negotiation: “1. A constant, zealous desire to dive into
the natives’ language. 2. God was pleased to give me a
painful, patient spirit to lodge with them in their filthy,
smoky holes, (even while I lived at Plymouth and Salem)
to gain their tongue. 3. I spared no cost towards them,
and in gifts to Ousamequin, yea, and all his, and to Canonicus,
and all his, tokens and presents, many years
before I came in person to the Narraganset, and when I
came, I was welcome to Ousamequin, and to the old
prince Canonicus, who was most shy of all English, to his
last breath. 4. I was known by all the Wampanoags
and the Narragansets to be a public speaker at Plymouth
and Salem, and, therefore, with them, held as a sachem.
5. I could debate with them (in a great measure) in their
own language. 6. I had the favor and countenance of
that noble soul, Mr. Winthrop, whom all Indians respected.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He proceeds to state, respecting Canonicus, that “it
was not thousands nor tens of thousands of money could
have bought of him an English entrance into this Bay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the deed, already quoted, he says, “By God’s merciful
assistance, I was the procurer of the purchase, not by
monies nor payment, the natives being so shy and jealous,
that monies could not do it, but by that language, acquaintance
and favor with the natives, and other advantages,
which it pleased God to give me; and also bore the
charges and venture of all the gratuities, which I gave to
the great sachems, and other sachems round about us, and
lay engaged for a loving and peaceable neighborhood with
them, to my great charge and travel.”<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c010'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>These facts prove, that the lands were granted to Mr.
Williams, as a personal favor, as an expression of gratitude
on the part of the sachems, and as a remuneration
for presents, which they had been receiving from him for
several years. Mr. Williams, then, was entitled to make
the assertion, which is contained in his touching letter to
the town of Providence, in 1654: “I have been blamed
for parting with Moshassuck, and afterwards Pawtuxet,
(which were mine own, as truly as any man’s coat upon
his back) without reserving to myself a foot of land, or an
inch of voice, more than to my servants and strangers.”<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c010'><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams was thus the legal proprietor of the lands
which were ceded to him, and he might have remained
so, if he had pleased. He had a clear title from the Indians,
and he had, a few years later certainly, sufficient
influence with the rulers in England, to obtain a recognition
of his rights, and a confirmation of his authority.
He might, doubtless, have been, like William Penn, the
proprietary of his colony, and might have exercised a control
over its government. He would, we may easily believe,
have exercised his authority as wisely and beneficially
as the great legislator of Pennsylvania. The peace of his
settlement and his own comfort would, perhaps, have been
promoted, if he had retained this power awhile, instead of
committing it to the whole company of settlers, among whom,
from the nature of the colony, as a refuge for “all sorts of
consciences,” some heterogeneous and discordant tempers
might be expected to find admission. That he was blamed
for this conduct, we know from his letter to the town of
Providence, already quoted;<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c010'><sup>[147]</sup></a> and as that letter was written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>soon after his return from England, we may infer, that
the censure came from leading men there.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he chose to found his colony on pure democratic principles;
as a commonwealth, where all civil power should
be exercised by the people alone, and where God should
be the only ruler over the conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>We will now relate the facts respecting his division of
the lands among his associates.</p>

<p class='c009'>The persons who accompanied him, at his first landing,
were William Harris, John Smith, Joshua Verin, Thomas
Angell and Francis Wickes. Several others joined him
at various times, previously to October 8, 1638, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>which day, Mr. Williams executed an instrument, of the
following tenor.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c010'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“<em>Providence, 8th of the 8th month, 1638</em>, (<em>so called.</em>)</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>On the 20th of December, 1661, the following deed was
executed. It is inserted here, because it is an interesting
document, and it throws much light on the transactions
which we are considering.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Be it known unto all men by these presents, that I,
Roger Williams, of the town of Providence, in the Narraganset
Bay, in New-England, having, in the year one
thousand six hundred thirty-four, and in the year one thousand
six hundred thirty-five, had several treaties with Canonicus
and Miantinomo, the two chief sachems of the
Narraganset, and in the end purchased of them the lands
and meadows upon the two fresh rivers called Moshassuck
and Wanasquatucket, the two sachems having, by a deed,
under their hands, two years after the sale thereof, established
and confirmed the bounds of these lands from the
rivers and fields of Pawtucket, the great hill of Notaquoncanot
on the northwest, and the town of Mashapaug on
the west, notwithstanding I had the frequent promise of
Miantinomo, my kind friend, that it should not be land
that I should want about these bounds mentioned, provided
that I satisfied the Indians there inhabiting. I having
made covenant of peaceable neighborhood with all
the sachems and natives round about us, and having, of a
sense of God’s merciful Providence unto me in my distress,
called the place Providence, I desired it might be for a
shelter for persons distressed for conscience. I then considering
the condition of divers of my distressed countrymen,
I communicated my said purchase unto my loving
friends, John Throckmorton, William Arnold, William
Harris, Stukely Westcott, John Greene, Senior, Thomas
Olney, Senior, Richard Waterman, and others, who then
desired to take shelter here with me, and in succession
unto so many others as we should receive into the fellowship
and society of enjoying and disposing of the said purchase;
and besides the first that were admitted, our town
records declare, that afterwards we received Chad
Brown, William Field, Thomas Harris, Senior, William
Wickenden, Robert Williams, Gregory Dexter, and others,
as our town book declares; and whereas, by God’s merciful
assistance, I was the procurer of the purchase, not by
monies nor payment, the natives being so shy and jealous
that monies could not do it, but by that language, acquaintance
and favor with the natives, and other advantages,
which it pleased God to give me, and also bore the charges
and venture of all the gratuities, which I gave to the great
sachems and other sachems and natives round about us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and lay engaged for a loving and peaceable neighborhood
with them, to my great charge and travel; it was therefore
thought fit by some loving friends, that I should receive
some loving consideration and gratuity, and it was
agreed between us, that every person, that should be admitted
into the fellowship of enjoying land and disposing
of the purchase, should pay thirty shillings unto the public
stock; and first, about thirty pounds should be paid unto
myself, by thirty shillings a person, as they were admitted;
this sum I received, and in love to my friends, and with
respect to a town and place of succor for the distressed
as aforesaid, I do acknowledge the said sum and payment
as full satisfaction; and whereas in the year one thousand
six hundred and thirty-seven,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c010'><sup>[151]</sup></a> so called, I delivered the
deed subscribed by the two aforesaid chief sachems, so
much thereof as concerneth the aforementioned lands,
from myself and from my heirs, unto the whole number of
the purchasers, with all my power, right and title therein,
reserving only unto myself one single share equal unto
any of the rest of that number; I now again, in a more
formal way, under my hand and seal, confirm my former
resignation of that deed of the lands aforesaid, and bind
myself, my heirs, my executors, my administrators and

</div>

<p class='c009'>From this document, it appears, that the twelve persons
to whom the lands, on the Moshassuck and Wanasquatucket
rivers, were conveyed by Mr. Williams, did not pay him
any part of the thirty pounds, which he received; but that
the sum of thirty shillings was exacted of every person
who was afterwards admitted, to form a common stock.
From this stock, thirty pounds were paid to Mr. Williams,
for the reasons mentioned in the instrument last quoted.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c010'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>For the lands on the Pawtuxet river, however, Mr.
Williams received twelve-thirteenths of twenty pounds,
from the twelve persons named in the deed of October
8, 1638. On the same day, the following instrument was
executed:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is agreed, this day abovesaid, that all the meadow
grounds at Pawtuxet, bounding upon the fresh river, on
both sides, are to be impropriated unto those thirteen persons,
being now incorporated together in our town of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Providence, viz.: Ezekiel Holliman, Francis Weston,
Roger Williams, Thomas Olney, Robert Cole, William
Carpenter, William Harris, John Throckmorton, Richard
Waterman, John Greene, Thomas James, William Arnold,
Stukely Westcott; and to be equally divided among them,
and every one to pay an equal proportion to raise up the
sum of twenty pounds for the same; and if it shall come
to pass, that some, or any one, of these thirteen persons
aforesaid, do not pay or give satisfaction of his or their
equal proportion of the aforesaid sum of twenty pounds,
by this day eight weeks, which will be the 17th day of the
10th month next ensuing, then they or he shall leave their
or his proportion of meadow grounds unto the rest of those
thirteen persons, to be at their disposing, who shall make
up the whole sum of twenty pounds, which is to be paid to
Roger Williams.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This money was punctually paid on the 3d of December
following, and was acknowledged as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“According to former agreement, I received of the
neighbors abovesaid, the full sum of £18 11<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> Per me,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>ROGER WILLIAMS.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He thus retained an equal share in the lands on the
Pawtuxet river, which were very valuable to the new settlers,
on account of the natural meadows along its banks. These
lands were afterwards the occasion of a protracted contention.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the facts which we have stated, it appears, that
Mr. Williams generously admitted the first twelve proprietors
of the Providence purchase to an equal share with
himself, without exacting from them any remuneration.
The thirty pounds which he received were paid by succeeding
settlers, at the rate of thirty shillings each. But
this sum of thirty pounds was not paid to him, as an equivalent
for the land. It was, as he calls it, a “loving gratuity,”
and was intended to remunerate him for the
presents which he had given to the Indians, and for the
expenses which he had incurred in procuring the lands.
But he affirmed, that all which he received was far less
than he expended.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c010'><sup>[155]</sup></a> The same may be said respecting
the money paid for the Pawtuxet lands.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>The conduct of Mr. Williams, in these transactions,
must be acknowledged to have been highly honorable, disinterested
and liberal. He held the title to the whole territory,
and he might, apparently, have amassed wealth and
gratified ambition, by retaining the control of the town,
and selling the lands, to be held of him as the proprietor.
But he renounced all plans of power and emolument; he
placed himself on an equality with the other settlers, and
surrendered the territory to the whole body of freemen,
among whom he claimed no other influence than that which
sprung from his personal character. The sum which he
received was not even a remuneration for his actual expenses
in procuring the territory.</p>

<p class='c009'>It does not diminish this praise, that the settlers were
obliged to satisfy the claims of many individual Indians.
The grant from the sachems might, perhaps, have been
considered as a full title; but the justice and humanity of
Roger Williams and his friends, led them to make compensation
to the natives who occupied the territory. The
whole sum paid to Mr. Williams and to the Indians, for
Providence and Pawtuxet, was stated by William Harris,
in 1677, to have been one hundred and sixty pounds.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Settlement of the town of Providence—Whatcheer—islands of Prudence,
Patience and Hope.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our account of the division of the lands has led us
onward to a period more than two years after Mr. Williams’
arrival. Some time must have been spent in his negotiations
with the sachems; but he certainly erected a house
soon after his landing, for in a letter, written within a
short time from that event, he says, “Miantinomo kept his
barbarous court lately at my house,” and in his letter to
Major Mason, he mentions, that he entertained General
Stoughton, at his house, in May, 1637, when the Massachusetts
troops were on their march against the Pequods.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is probable, that Mrs. Williams and her two children
came from Salem to Providence, in the summer of 1636,
in company with several persons, who wished to join their
exiled pastor.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c010'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The family of Mr. Williams was now dependent on his
exertions for support. No supplies could be derived from
Massachusetts. The natives were unable to afford much
aid. It is probable, that Mr. Williams had nearly expended
all his funds, in the support of his family during his
absence, and in the negotiations with the Indians. Of his
poverty,<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c010'><sup>[157]</sup></a> there is evidence, in a touching incident, mentioned
in his letter to Major Mason. It is alike honorable
to all the parties: “It pleased the Father of Spirits to touch
many hearts, dear to him, with many relentings; amongst
which, that great and pious soul, Mr. Winslow, melted,
and kindly visited me at Providence, and put a piece of
gold into the hands of my wife, for our supply.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a deed, which was enrolled January 29, 1667, Mr.
Williams says, that he planted, with his own hands, at his
first coming, the two Indian fields, Whatcheer and Saxifrax
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Hill, which he had purchased of the natives. Thus
was he forced, as at many other times, to resort to manual
labor for his subsistence. In his reply to Mr. Cotton, (p.
38) he says: “It is not unknown to many witnesses, in
Plymouth, Salem and Providence, that the discusser’s time
hath not been spent (though as much as any others whosoever)
altogether in spiritual labors and public exercises of
the word; but day and night, at home and abroad, on the
land and water, at the hoe, at the oar, for bread.” But he
sustained all his labors and hardships with a patient spirit,
and with a steadfast adherence to his principles.</p>

<p class='c009'>His house was, undoubtedly, erected near the spot
where he landed, and a few rods eastward of the celebrated
spring.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c010'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Here the wanderer found a resting place.
This was his home, for more than forty years. Here he
died, and near the site of his dwelling his ashes were
deposited.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be an interesting effort of the imagination, to
contrast the situation of Providence at the time of the
settlement, with the present condition of that beautiful and
flourishing town. Where now are busy streets, and ample
warehouses, and elegant mansions, and a population of
nearly 20,000 souls, were, at that time, dense forests,
and a few scattered Indian families. How astonishing is
the change! Roger Williams himself, with all his vigor of
imagination, and his ardent temperament, could not have
anticipated the expansion of his little settlement to its
present amplitude, beauty and strength. The glorious
vision could not have visited his mind; but he acted under
the power of that prophetic faith, which assured him of
success, in his efforts for the welfare of men. He looked
beyond the present, to the bright future, and was confident,
that his principles, though then misunderstood and rejected,
would ultimately triumph.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of two years, Mr. Williams was joined by
a number of friends from Massachusetts, with whom, as
we have seen, he shared the lands which he had obtained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The community, thus formed, were invested with the
power of admitting others to the privileges of citizenship.
Their number was soon increased, by emigrants from
Massachusetts, and from Europe.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c010'><sup>[159]</sup></a> It was the design of
Mr. Williams, that his colony should be open to all persons
who might choose to reside there, without regard to their
religious opinions. He was careful, nevertheless, to provide
for the maintenance of the civil peace. Every inhabitant
was required to subscribe the following covenant:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We, whose names are here underwritten, being desirous
to inhabit in the town of Providence, do promise to
submit ourselves, in active or passive obedience, to all such
orders or agreements as shall be made for public good of
the body, in an orderly way, by the major consent of the
present inhabitants, masters of families, incorporated together
into a township, and such others whom they shall
admit unto the same, <em>only in civil things</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This simple instrument, which combines the principles of
a pure democracy, and of unrestricted religious liberty, was
the basis of the first government in Providence. It was
undoubtedly drawn up by Roger Williams. It bears the
impress of his character, and it was the germ of those free
institutions, under which Rhode-Island has flourished till
the present day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The government of the town was thus placed in the
hands of the inhabitants; and the legislative, judicial and
executive functions were exercised, for several years, by the
citizens in town meeting. Two deputies were appointed,
from time to time, whose duties were, to preserve order, to
settle disputes, to call town meetings, to preside in them,
and to see that their resolutions were executed.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c010'><sup>[160]</sup></a> But the
power of the deputies was very limited, and their term of
office short. A form of government so simple could not
exist, except in a small community, and among men whose
moral principles were pure, and their habits peaceful.
Winthrop was mistaken, when he asserted of the settlers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>at Providence, that they “would have no magistrates.”<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c010'><sup>[161]</sup></a>
If they had not the usual forms, they had the essence of
magistracy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The settlers applied themselves to agriculture, for subsistence.
An intelligent antiquarian, of Providence, whose
opinions are authority on all points touching its early history,
says,<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c010'><sup>[162]</sup></a> that the first inhabitants settled “on such places
as were most convenient, and planted their corn on the old
Indian fields, as they could agree among themselves.
When their number had increased, they laid out what is
now the Main street, on the east side of the river, and
divided the land eastward of the street, into lots of six
acres each, being of equal breadth, and extending back to
what is now Hope street. There were eventually one hundred
and two of these six acre lots, extending from Mile
End Brook, which enters the river a little north of Fox
Point, to Harrington’s Lane, on the north, which lane is
now the dividing line between Providence and North
Providence. Each proprietor had one of these six acre
lots, and on which he built his house. How they were
located, whether by lot or draft, or by choice, I am not
informed; but it is probable that the first comers had their
choice, as the six acre lot of Roger Williams was the place
where he first landed, and had built his house.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c010'><sup>[163]</sup></a> The
street, now Bowen street, leading from Main to Benefit
street, divides that part of his lot nearly in the middle.
The object of locating themselves so near together was for
security and mutual aid against the Indians, and in conformity
to the practice in Europe. Each proprietor, besides
his town lot, as it was called, took up out land, upland and
meadows, by grant of the whole in proprietors’ meeting.
These grants were entered on the records. None of them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>at first, took up sufficient for a farm in one place. Each
one, besides his <em>upland</em>, as it was termed, or planting land,
had, in another place, and frequently quite distant, his proportion
of meadow land. This was necessary, because
there was no hay seed known or in use. They had no
grass for winter fodder, but bog or salt meadow, or thatch,
and each must have his share of this, or his cattle would
perish, or browse in the woods in winter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger Williams, in addition to his six acre town lot,
had a lot in the neighborhood of Whatcheer cove. The
deed, already quoted, may be appropriately introduced here,
as a document which belongs to the history of Roger Williams
and of the town:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whereas, by the good Providence of God, I, Roger
Williams, purchased this plantation of the natives, partly
by the favors which I had long before with the sachems
gotten at my cost and hazard, and partly with my own
monies, paid them, in satisfaction for the settling of the
said plantation, in the midst of the barbarians round about
us; and whereas for the name of God and public good, and
especially for the receiving of such as were troubled elsewhere
about the worship of God, I freely parted with my
whole purchase unto the township, or commonalty, of the
then inhabitants, and yet reserved to myself the two
Indian fields, called Whatcheer and Saxifrax Hill, as having
peculiarly satisfied the owners of those fields for them,
besides my general purchase of the whole from the sachems,
and also planted both those fields at my first coming as my
own peculiar with mine own hands, and whereas the town
of Providence by their deputies, then called five Disposers,
William Field was one, long since laid out unto me the
aforesaid field called Whatcheer, and adjoined my six
acre lot unto it, making up together twelve acres by the
eighteen foot pole, and I having forgotten my bounds, the
town deputies, William Field and Arthur Fenner, have
since laid out and measured the said twelve acres unto me
by the eighteen foot pole as aforesaid. These are to certify
unto all men, that I, the said Roger Williams, have, for
a full satisfaction already received from James Ellis, of
Providence, sold and demised unto the said James Ellis,
the said twelve acres aforesaid, bounded on the east by
the river, on the west by a highway between the said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>twelve acres and the land of Nicholas Power deceased, on
the north by a highway lying between the said twelve acres
and William Field’s land, and on the south by Mr. Benedict
Arnold’s land; the aforesaid twelve acres I do by these
presents demise and alienate from myself, my heirs, executors,
&amp;c. to the aforesaid James Ellis, his heirs, executors,
&amp;c. with all the appertenances and privileges thereof.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may mention here, that Mr. Williams obtained the
island of <em>Prudence</em>, from the Indians, and held it as a joint
proprietor with Governor Winthrop, of Massachusetts.
The following letter relates to this transaction:<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c010'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“The bearer, Miantinomo, resolving to go on his visit, I
am bold to request a word of advice from you, concerning
a proposition made by Canonicus and himself to me some
half year since. Canonicus gave an island in this bay to
Mr. Oldham, by name Chibachuwese, upon condition, as it
should seem, that he would dwell there near unto them.
The Lord (in whose hands all our hearts are) turning their
affections towards myself, they desired me to remove thither
and dwell nearer to them. I have answered once and
again, that for the present I mind not to remove; but if I
have it from them, I would give them satisfaction for it, and
build a little house and put in some swine, as understanding
the place to have store of fish and good feeding for
swine. Of late I have heard, that Mr. Gibbons, upon
occasion, motioned your desire and his own of putting
some swine on some of these islands, which hath made me
since more desire to obtain it, because I might thereby not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>only benefit myself, but also pleasure yourself, whom I
more desire to pleasure and honor. I spoke of it now to
this sachem, and he tells me, that because of the store of
fish, Canonicus desires that I would accept half, (it being
spectacle-wise, and between a mile or two in circuit, as I
guess) and he would reserve the other; but I think, if I go
over, I shall obtain the whole. Your loving counsel, how
far it may be inoffensive, because it was once (upon a condition
not kept,) Mr. Oldham’s. So, with respective
salutes to your kind self and Mrs. Winthrop, I rest,</p>

<p class='c009'>“For his much honored Mr. Governor, these.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Governor Winthrop retained his moiety of the island,
and gave it, in his will, to his son Stephen.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c010'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams also owned the islands <em>Patience</em> and <em>Hope</em>.
The names of the three islands are indicative of his mind.
William Harris said, in 1677, in a somewhat reproachful
tone, that these islands were “all put away.” Mr. Williams
sold them, perhaps, as he certainly did some other
portions of his property, to maintain himself and family,
during his long and unrequited toils, in England, for the
welfare of the colony. To a native of Rhode-Island, these
islands should be interesting monuments of the virtues and
services of her founder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus stated the manner in which the settlement
at Providence was commenced, we must now return to the
period of the first arrival of Mr. Williams, and narrate briefly
his agency in averting the imminent danger of a general
league among the natives for the destruction of the
colonists.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Williams prevents the Indian league—war with the Pequods—their
defeat and ruin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Pequods were, as we have already remarked, the
most warlike tribe of Indians in New-England, and the
most hostile to the colonists, not perhaps so much from a
greater degree of ferocity, as from a clearer foresight of the
effects which the natives had reason to apprehend from the
increase of the whites.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1634, Captains Stone and Norton, of Massachusetts,
with eight other Englishmen, were murdered by the Indians,
in a small trading vessel, on Connecticut river. It
is not certain, that the murderers were Pequods, but they
fled to this tribe for protection, and divided with them the
property which they had plundered. The Pequods thus
became responsible for the crime; and the magistrates of
Massachusetts sent to them messengers to demand satisfaction,
but without success. The Pequods afterwards sent
messengers, with gifts, to Massachusetts, exculpating the
tribe from the guilt of the murder. The Governor and
Council, after a conference of several days, and a consultation,
as usual, with the principal ministers, concluded
with them a treaty of peace and friendship.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c010'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>But no treaty could appease the jealous hostility of the
Pequods. In July, 1636, a short time after Mr. Williams’
removal to Providence, a party of Indians murdered Mr.
John Oldham, near Block-Island, whither he had gone
from Massachusetts, in a small barque, for purposes of
trade. The murderers fled to the Pequods, by whom they
were protected. It was suspected, however, that the murder
was contrived by some of the Narragansets and Nianticks;
and there was evidently some disposition among
these tribes and the Pequods to form a league for the destruction
of the English.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first intelligence of the murder of Mr. Oldham, and
of the proposed league, was communicated by Mr. Williams,
in a letter to Governor Vane, at Boston, a few days
after the event. With a spirit of forgiveness and philanthropy,
which honors his memory, he promptly informed
those who had so recently expelled him from the colony,
of the peril which now threatened them. It may be
alleged, that self-preservation impelled him to appeal to
Massachusetts for assistance to defeat a project, which, if
accomplished, would have overwhelmed himself and his
colony in ruin. But his influence with the Indians was so
great, that it is probable he might have secured his own
safety and that of his companions. The merit of his generous
mediation ought not to be sullied, because his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>welfare was at the same time advanced. Violent passions
often make men forget or disregard their own interests. A
vindictive spirit might have been willing to hazard its own
safety, for the pleasure of ample vengeance on the authors
of its wrongs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Massachusetts government, on the 24th of August,
sent by water an armed force of eighty volunteers, under
the command of John Endicott, Esq. with instructions to
“put to death the men of Block-Island, but to spare the
women and children, and to bring them away, and to take
possession of the island; and from thence to go to the Pequods,
to demand the murderers of Captain Stone and
other English, some thousand fathoms of wampum, for
damages, and some of their children as hostages, which, if
they should refuse, they were to obtain it by force.”<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c010'><sup>[167]</sup></a>
These stern orders were not strictly executed; yet many
Indians were killed, a large number of wigwams were
burnt, at Block-Island and on Connecticut river, some
corn was destroyed, and other damage was done. The
troops returned to Boston, on the 14th of September, without
the loss of a man.</p>

<p class='c009'>This expedition had little effect, except to exasperate the
natives. Mr. Endicott was the object of many censures for
returning, without striking a severer blow. But his force
was small, the winter was approaching, and prudence, undoubtedly,
required his return.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Pequods became more decidedly hostile. They killed
several white persons, and made strenuous efforts to induce
the powerful Narraganset tribe to forget their mutual animosity,
and join with them in a war of extermination
against the English. “There had been,” says Hutchinson,
(vol. i. p. 60) “a fixed, inveterate enmity, between the
two tribes; but on this occasion the Pequods were willing
to smother it, their enmity against the English being the
strongest of the two: and although they had never heard
the story of Polypheme and Ulysses, yet they artfully urged,
that the English were come to dispossess them of their
country, and that all the Narragansets could hope for from
their friendship, was the favor of being the last devoured:
whereas, if the Indians would unite, they might easily destroy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the English, or force them to leave the country, without
being exposed themselves to any hazard. They need
not come to open battles; firing their houses, killing their
cattle, and lying in wait for them as they went about their
ordinary business, would soon deprive them of all means
of subsisting. But the Narragansets preferred the present
pleasure of revenge upon their mortal enemies, to the
future happiness of themselves and their posterity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief merit of preventing this league, and thus,
perhaps, saving the whites from destruction, is due to Mr.
Williams. The magistrates of Massachusetts solicited his
mediation with the Narragansets. They did not ask it in
vain. Mr. Williams instantly undertook the service, and
with much toil, expense and hazard, he succeeded in defeating
the endeavors of the Pequods to win over the Narragansets
to a coalition against the English. Mr. Williams,
in his letter to Major Mason, has incidentally related his
agency in this affair. It is due to him, to quote here his
own simple and energetic words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upon letters received from the Governor and Council
at Boston, requesting me to use my utmost and speediest
endeavors to break and hinder the league labored for by
the Pequods and Mohegans against the English, (excusing
the not sending of company and supplies by the haste of
the business) the Lord helped me immediately to put my
life into my hand, and, scarce acquainting my wife, to
ship myself alone, in a poor canoe, and to cut through a
stormy wind, with great seas, every minute in hazard of
life, to the sachem’s house. Three days and nights my
business forced me to lodge and mix with the bloody Pequod
ambassadors, whose hands and arms, methought,
reeked with the blood of my countrymen, murdered and
massacred by them on Connecticut river, and from whom
I could not but nightly look for their bloody knives at my
own throat also. God wondrously preserved me, and
helped me to break to pieces the Pequods’ negotiation and
design; and to make and finish, by many travels and
charges, the English league with the Narragansets and
Mohegans against the Pequods.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In consequence of Mr. Williams’ agency, the Narraganset
sachem, Miantinomo, came to Boston, on the 21st of
October, 1636, with two sons of Canonicus, besides another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>sachem, and about twenty attendants. He was received
with much parade, and a treaty of perpetual peace and
alliance was concluded, in which it was stipulated, that
neither party should make peace with the Pequods without
the consent of the other.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c010'><sup>[168]</sup></a> Governor Winthrop mentions
a circumstance, which is highly honorable to Mr. Williams,
because it proves the confidence which was reposed
in him, both by the Indians and by the government of
Massachusetts. The treaty was written in the English
language, and as it was found difficult to make the Indians
understand the articles perfectly, “we agreed,” says Winthrop,
“to send a copy of them to Mr. Williams, who
could best interpret them to them.” This measure was
probably adopted, at the suggestion of the Indians, who
knew that Mr. Williams was their friend, and would neither
himself deceive them, nor connive at any attempt at deception
on the part of others. It is a proof, also, of the
integrity of the Massachusetts rulers, on this occasion, that
they were willing to submit their proceedings to the scrutiny
of a man, whom they knew to be a steadfast advocate
of the rights of the Indians.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Pequods, though disappointed in their attempts to
secure the alliance of the Narragansets, resolved to maintain
the conflict single handed. They probably thought,
that it was better policy to make one desperate effort to
overpower the English, though aided by the Narragansets,
than to wait for the gradual approach of that ruin, which
they had the forecast to apprehend from the multiplication
of the colonists. It was a bold though a hopeless effort.
Their undisciplined bravery and simple weapons were unequal
to a contest with the military skill and the fire-arms
of the English.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following letter from Mr. Williams to Governor
Winthrop was written at some time between August, 1636,
and May, 1637.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c010'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

      <div class='line'>“Sir,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“The latter end of the last week, I gave notice to our
neighbor princes of your intentions and preparations
against the common enemy, the Pequods. At my first
coming to them, Canonicus (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">morosus æque ac barbarus
senex</span>) was very sour, and accused the English and myself
for sending the plague amongst them, and threatening to
kill him especially.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such tidings (it seems) were lately brought to his ears
by some of his flatterers and our ill-willers. I discerned
cause of bestirring myself, and staid the longer, and at
last (through the mercy of the Most High) I not only
sweetened his spirit, but possessed him, that the plague and
other sicknesses were alone in the hand of the one God,
who made him and us, who being displeased with the
English for lying, stealing, idleness and uncleanness, (the
natives’ epidemical sins,) smote many thousands of us ourselves
with general and late mortalities.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miantinomo kept his barbarous court lately at my house,
and with him I have far better dealing. He takes some
pleasure to visit me, and sent me word of his coming over
again some eight days hence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They pass not a week without some skirmishes, though
hitherto little loss on either side. They were glad of your
preparations, and in much conference with themselves and
others, (fishing, de-industria, for instructions from them)
I gathered these observations, which you may please (as
cause may be) to consider and take notice of:</p>

<p class='c009'>“1. They conceive, that to do execution to purpose on
the Pequods, will require not two or three days and away,
but a riding by it and following of the work to and again
the space of three weeks or a month; that there be a falling
off and a retreat, as if you were departed, and a falling
on again within three or four days, when they are returned
again to their houses securely from their flight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“2. That if any pinnaces come in ken, they presently
prepare for flight, women and old men and children, to a
swamp some three or four miles on the back of them, a
marvellous great and secure swamp, which they called
Ohomowauke, which signifies owl’s nest, and by another
name, Cappacommock, which signifies a refuge, or hiding
place, as I conceive.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“3. That, therefore, Niantick (which is Miantinomo’s
place of rendezvous) be thought on for the riding and retiring
to of vessel or vessels, which place is faithful to the
Narragansets, and at present enmity with the Pequods.</p>

<p class='c009'>“4. They also conceive it easy for the English, that the
provisions and munition first arrive at Aquetneck, called
by us Rhode-Island, at the Narraganset’s mouth, and then
a messenger may be despatched hither, and so to the Bay,
for the soldiers to march up by land to the vessels, who
otherwise might spend long time about the Cape, and fill
more vessels than needs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“5. That the assault would be in the night, when they
are commonly more secure and at home, by which advantage
the English, being armed, may enter the houses and
do what execution they please.</p>

<p class='c009'>“6. That before the assault be given, an ambush be laid
behind them, between them and the swamp, to prevent
their flight, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>“7. That to that purpose, such guides as shall be best
liked of be taken along to direct, especially two Pequods,
viz. Wequash and Wuttackquiackommin, valiant men,
especially the latter, who have lived these three or four
years with the Narragansets, and know every pass and passage
among them, who desire armor to enter their houses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“8. That it would be pleasing to all natives, that women
and children be spared, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>“9. That if there be any more land travel to Connecticut,
some course would also be taken with the Wunnashowatuckoogs,
who are confederates with and a refuge to
the Pequods.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, if any thing be sent to the princes, I find that
Canonicus would gladly accept of a box of eight or ten
pounds of sugar, and indeed he told me he would thank
Mr. Governor for a box full.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, you may please to take notice of a rude view how
the Pequods lie:</p>

<p class='c009'>[Here follows a rude map of the Pequod and Mohegan
country.]</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thus, with my best salutes to your worthy selves and

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“For his much honored Mr. Governor, and Mr. Winthrop,
Deputy Governor, of the Massachusetts, these.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Pequods now prosecuted the war with all the cruelty
of savages. They murdered several individuals, whom they
found at work in the fields, or surprised on the rivers; and
some of them they put to death with barbarous tortures.
They attacked the fort at Saybrook, at the mouth of Connecticut
river. They thus spread alarm through the colonies.
Massachusetts, Plymouth and Connecticut immediately
agreed to invade the Indian territory, with their joint
forces, and attempt the entire destruction of the Pequods.
Massachusetts accordingly sent 120 men, under General
Stoughton, with Mr. Wilson, of Boston, as their chaplain,
an indispensable attendant of a military expedition in those
days. They marched by the way of Providence, and were
hospitably entertained, at that place, by Mr. Williams. His
own account of the transaction may be properly quoted:
“When the English forces marched up to the Narraganset
country, against the Pequods, I gladly entertained at my
house, in Providence, the General Stoughton and his
officers, and used my utmost care, that all his officers and
soldiers should be well accommodated with us.”<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c010'><sup>[170]</sup></a> He accompanied
the troops to Narraganset, where, by his influence,
he established a mutual confidence between them
and the Indians. He then returned to Providence, and
acted through the war as a medium of intercourse between
the government of Massachusetts, the army and the Indians.</p>

<p class='c009'>Major Mason, with seventy-seven men from Connecticut
and Massachusetts, and several hundred Narraganset and
other Indians,<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c010'><sup>[171]</sup></a> attacked the Pequods, in May, 1637, at Mistick
fort, near a river of that name, in the county of New-London,
a few miles east of Fort Griswold. In this fort,
five or six hundred Pequods, men, women and children,
had taken refuge, and had fortified it, as well as their skill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>would permit, with palisadoes, which offered but a feeble
defence, and presented no obstacle to musketry. They
made a desperate resistance, but as they were armed only
with bows, tomahawks and English hatchets, they killed
and wounded but a few of the assailants, while the English
troops poured in a destructive fire, and then rushed into
the fort, sword in hand. The slaughter was dreadful, the
warriors falling by the bullet and the sword, and the old
men, women and children perishing in the flames. The
action lasted an hour, and terminated in the burning of the
fort, and the death of all its inmates, except a few prisoners.</p>

<p class='c009'>A considerable number of the Pequods were soon after
killed in a battle in a great swamp. The tribe was extinguished.
Sassacus, the Pequod sachem, fled to the Mohawks,
by whom he was murdered. Such of the Pequods
as were not killed, were either sent to Bermuda, and sold
for slaves, or mingled with the Narragansets and other
tribes.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c010'><sup>[172]</sup></a> Thus the brave and powerful Pequods disappeared
forever, and such was the terror which this victory
spread among the savages, that they refrained from open
hostilities for nearly forty years. A day of thanksgiving
was kept by all the churches in Massachusetts, in commemoration
of the victory, from which their soldiers had
returned, without the loss of a man killed in battle. The
account given by Winthrop is characteristic of those times:
“The captains and soldiers who had been in the late service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>were feasted, and after the sermon, the magistrates
and elders accompanied them to the door of the house
where they dined.” Miantinomo, the Narraganset sachem,
visited Boston, in November, to negotiate with the government,
and acknowledged that all the Pequod country and
Block-Island belonged to Massachusetts, and promised that
he would not meddle with it without their leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have seen the part which Mr. Williams took in this
war, and may ascribe to him no small share in producing
its favorable termination. Some of the leading men in
Massachusetts felt, that he deserved some acknowledgment
of gratitude for his services. He says, in his letter to Major
Mason, that Governor Winthrop “and some other of
the council motioned, and it was debated, whether or no I
had not merited, not only to be recalled from banishment,
but also to be honored with some mark of favor. It is
known who hindered, [alluding, it is supposed, to Mr.
Dudley] who never promoted the liberty of other men’s
consciences.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His principles, however, were not then viewed with more
favor than at the time of his banishment; and the fear of
their contagious influence overcame the sentiment of gratitude
for his magnanimous conduct and invaluable services
during the war. It was not himself, so much as his doctrines,
which his opponents disliked. To those doctrines
they were conscientiously hostile; and they were not the
only men who have thought that they did God service, by
stifling the generous emotions of the heart, in obedience to
the stern dictates of a mistaken sense of duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following letter from Mr. Williams may be properly
quoted here. It is supposed to have been written on the
20th of August, 1637. It relates to the affairs of the Indians,
and shows that the division of the Pequod captives,
and other causes, occasioned some distrust and irritation
between the English and the Narragansets. Mr. Williams
endeavored to preserve peace and foster friendship among
all parties.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yours by Yotaash (Miantinomo’s brother) received. I
accompanied him to the Narragansets, and having got Canonicus
and Miantinomo, with their council, together, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>acquainted them faithfully with the contents of your letter,
both grievances and threatenings; and to demonstrate, I
produced the copy of the league, (which Mr. Vane sent
me) and with breaking of a straw in two or three places, I
showed them what they had done.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In sum their answer was, that they thought they should
prove themselves honest and faithful, when Mr. Governor
understood their answers; and that (although they would
not contend with their friends,) yet they could relate many
particulars, wherein the English had broken (since these
wars) their promises, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First, then, concerning the Pequod squaws, Canonicus
answered, that he never saw any, but heard of some that
came into these parts, and he bade carry them back to Mr.
Governor; but since he never heard of them till I came,
and now he would have the country searched for them.
Miantinomo answered, that he never heard of but six, and
four he saw which were brought to him, at which he was
angry, and asked why they did not carry them to me, that
I might convey them home again. Then he bid the natives
that brought them to carry them to me, who, departing,
brought him word that the squaws were lame, and
they could not travel. Whereupon, he sent me word that
I should send for them. This I must acknowledge, that
this message I received from him, and sent him word that
we were but few here, and could not fetch them nor convey
them, and therefore desired him to send men with
them, and to seek out the rest. Then, saith he, we were
busy ten or twelve days together, as indeed they were, in
a strange kind of solemnity, wherein the sachems ate nothing
but at night, and all the natives round about the country
were feasted. In which time, saith he, I wished some to
look to them, which, notwithstanding, at this time, they
escaped; and now he would employ men instantly to search
all places for them, and within two or three days to convey
them home. Besides, he professed that he desired them
not, and was sorry the Governor should think he did. I
objected, that he sent to beg one. He answered, that Sassamun,
being sent by the Governor with letters to Pequod,
fell lame, and, lying at his house, told him of a squaw he
saw, which was a sachem’s daughter, who, while he lived,
was his (Miantinomo’s) great friend. He therefore desired,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>in kindness to his dead friend, to beg her, or redeem
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Concerning his departure from the English, and leaving
them without guides, he answered, first, that they had been
faithful, many hundreds of them, (though they were solicited
to the contrary;) that they stuck to the English in life
or death, without which they were persuaded that Uncas
and the Mohegans had proved false, (as he fears they
will yet) as also that they never had found a Pequod; and
therefore, saith he, sure there was some cause. I desired
to know it. He replied in these words, Chenock eiuse
wetompatimucks? that is, did ever friends deal so with
friends? I urging wherein, he told me this tale: that his
brother, Yotaash, had seized upon Puttaquppuunch, Quame,
and twenty Pequods, and threescore squaws; they killed
three and bound the rest, watching them all night, and
sending for the English, delivered them to them in the
morning. Miantinomo (who, according to promise, came
by land with two hundred men, killing ten Pequods in
their march,) was desirous to see the great sachem whom
his brother had taken, being now in the English houses;
but, saith he, I was thrust at with a pike many times, that
I durst not come near the door. I objected, he was not
known. He and others affirmed he was, and asked if they
should have dealt so with Mr. Governor. I still denied
that he was known, &amp;c. Upon this, he saith, all my company
were disheartened, and they all, and Cutshamoquene,
desired to be gone; and yet, saith he, two of my men
(Wagonckwhut and Maunamoh) were their guides to Sesquankit
from the river’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, I dare not stir coals, but I saw them too much
disregarded by many, which their ignorance imputed to
all, and thence came the misprision, and blessed be the
Lord things were no worse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I objected, they received Pequods and wampum without
Mr. Governor’s consent. Canonicus replied, that
although he and Miantinomo had paid many hundred
fathom of wampum to their soldiers, as Mr. Governor did,
yet he had not received one yard of beads nor a Pequod.
Nor, saith Miantinomo, did I, but one small present from
four women of Long-Island, which were no Pequods, but
of that isle, being afraid, desired to put themselves under
my protection.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“By the next I shall add something more of consequence,
and which must cause our loving friends of Connecticut
to be very watchful, as also, if you please, their
grievances, which I have labored already to answer, to
preserve the English name; but now end abruptly, with

</div>

<p class='c014'>Settlement on Rhode-Island commenced—Mrs. Hutchinson—settlement
at Pawtuxet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little colony at Providence was rapidly increased by
the arrival of persons from the other colonies and from
Europe, attracted thither by the freedom which the conscience
there enjoyed. So tenaciously was this principle
held, that the town disfranchised one of its citizens, for
refusing to allow his wife to attend meeting as often as she
wished.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c010'><sup>[173]</sup></a> This act has been censured, as a deviation from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>their principles, because it inflicted a civil punishment on
a man, for conduct which he might allege to have sprung
from conscientious scruples. But this inconsistency, if it
was such, was an error on the right side. The woman
might have failed in duty to her husband, by an obstinate
contempt of his just authority, and a disregard of his reasonable
wishes. But the inhabitants of Providence were right
in adhering to the great principle, that our duties to God
are paramount to all human obligations; and that the right
to worship him, in the manner which we deem most acceptable
to him, is not, and cannot be, surrendered, even
by the marriage covenant.</p>

<p class='c009'>A settlement was made, in 1637–8, at Portsmouth, on the
north side of the island which gives name to the State.
The settlers were, like Mr. Williams and his companions,
exiles or emigrants from Massachusetts. The cause of
their removal may be traced to the singular ferment which
arose in Massachusetts, on account of Mrs. Hutchinson.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>This lady, with her husband, came to Boston, from
England, in 1636. She possessed talents, which she appears
to have felt no reluctance to display. She was treated
with great respect by Mr. Cotton, and by other distinguished
individuals, particularly by Governor Vane. It
was the custom of the members of the church to meet every
week, to repeat Mr. Cotton’s sermons, and converse on
religious doctrines. Mrs. Hutchinson commenced a meeting
of the females, in which she repeated the sermons, with
her own comments. Her eloquence was admired, and her
meetings were thronged. Her vanity was inflamed, and
she proceeded to announce opinions and doctrines, which
soon became the topic of conversation, and the source of
vehement contentions throughout the colony. Parties were
formed, among the ministers as well as the people; Mr.
Cotton himself being inclined to the side of Mrs. Hutchinson,
while most of the ministers and magistrates opposed
her. The opinions ascribed to her related to such points
as the nature of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the
person of the believer, and the connection between sanctification
and justification. From these opinions others, still
more heretical, were supposed to flow, and, as usually
happens, the inferences which men chose to form were
considered as substantial errors actually held by Mrs.
Hutchinson.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c010'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The alarm spread through the colony. The ministers
thronged to Boston, to confer with Mr. Cotton and others.
Long discussions ensued, without effect, and at length it
was resolved to try the virtue of a general synod. It was
accordingly held at Newtown, (now Cambridge) on the
30th of August, 1637, and was attended not only by all the
ministers and messengers of the churches, but by the
magistrates. Three weeks were spent in debates, during
which the mild spirit of Winthrop often interposed to soften
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the asperity of controversy. The synod collected, with
great industry, all the erroneous opinions then to be found
in the country, amounting to eighty-two, and finished its
session, by condemning these errors, and pronouncing its
judgment on certain points of church discipline.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c010'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The effect of the synod was the usual one, of increasing
the pertinacity with which the different parties held their
opinions. Mrs. Hutchinson continued her lectures, and
nearly all the members of the Boston church became her
converts. She forsook the public assemblies, and set up
a meeting in her own house. She accused the greater
part of the ministers in the country as preachers of error.
The civil power now interposed, to apply the remedy for
heresy, which has often been used, when argument had
failed. Mrs. Hutchinson was summoned before the General
Court, and many of the ministers. She was tried,
found guilty, and sentenced to be banished. The church
excommunicated her, though she is said to have recanted
her errors. Rev. Mr. Wheelwright, her brother-in-law,
who had publicly espoused her cause, was likewise banished.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Court proceeded to a more extraordinary measure.
Nearly sixty citizens of Boston, and a number in other
towns, were required to surrender their arms and ammunition
to a person appointed by the Court, under a penalty of
ten pounds; and were forbidden, under the same penalty,
to buy or borrow any arms or ammunition until further
orders. The pretence, as set forth in the act,<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c010'><sup>[176]</sup></a> was a fear,
that the principles which they had learned of Mrs. Hutchinson
and Mr. Wheelwright might impel them to disturb
the peace of the community, as certain persons in Germany
had done. Though anabaptism is not named, it is easy
to perceive, that this dreadful phantom, which so haunted
the imaginations of our ancestors, was, on this, as on other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>occasions, made the apology for oppressive measures. That
it was a mere pretext, in this case, we have the best reason
to believe, for Winthrop<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c010'><sup>[177]</sup></a> honestly attributes the act of
disarming these men, to the part which most of them had
taken in a remonstrance to the General Court against its
measures in relation to Mr. Wheelwright. The act itself
proves the same point, for it provides, that if any of them
would acknowledge their guilt in signing the “seditious
libel,” they should be exempted from its operation. The
General Court was as jealous of its prerogatives as King
James I.; and to prevent these individuals from expressing
their disapprobation by acts more energetic than a remonstrance,
the Court thought it prudent to deprive them of
offensive weapons. By an act, passed at the same session,
a severe punishment was decreed for those persons who
should speak evil of the judges or magistrates.</p>

<p class='c009'>These transactions have been recited, not only from
their connection with the settlement of Rhode-Island,
but because they furnish ample illustrations of the multiform
mischiefs which ensue from an interference by the
civil magistrate in the affairs of the church. Had Mrs.
Hutchinson been permitted, without notice, to expound
and prophecy as she pleased, it is probable that her zeal
would have soon spent itself, if unsupplied with fuel by
her vanity. Or if she had been left to the salutary discipline
of the church, as she would now be, no serious
effects would have followed. But the injudicious excitement
among the clergy, and still more, the improper conduct
of the magistrates, gave importance to the affair, and
produced a convulsion in the Commonwealth, which would
have ruined a community less intelligent and pious, and
the perils of which may be inferred from the act of the
General Court, disarming a portion of its citizens. The
Court, having assumed the office of inquisitors into the
religious opinions of men, was forced, by a regard to consistency,
to prosecute its measures to the end, and punish
the heretics by disfranchisement and expulsion from the
Commonwealth. Thus were the affections of many of the
inhabitants alienated from each other, and from the government,
and the colony was deprived of a large number of
its citizens.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>But God, whose high prerogative it is to educe good from
evil, made this unhappy feud in Massachusetts the occasion
of establishing a new settlement on Rhode-Island. Many
of the individuals who had been disarmed, and others who
were banished, removed from Massachusetts. Some of
them went to Connecticut, others to New-Hampshire, and
several to Providence. But a number of persons, among
whom was John Clarke, a learned physician, agreed to
migrate together, and requested him and some others to
select a suitable place. They accordingly proceeded to
New-Hampshire, in the autumn or winter of 1637, the
preceding summer having been so warm as to induce them
to seek a more northerly position. But the severity of the
winter in New-Hampshire turned their thoughts towards a
more genial clime. Mr. Clarke and his associates accordingly
proceeded southward, with a design to settle on Long-Island,
or on <em>Delaware Bay</em>. But at Providence, they were
kindly received by Mr. Williams, who advised them to
form a settlement at Sowams (now called Barrington, a
few miles from Providence) or at Aquetneck,<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c010'><sup>[178]</sup></a> (now called
Rhode-Island.) But as they had resolved to remove beyond
the limits both of Plymouth and of Massachusetts, Mr.
Williams, Mr. Clarke, and two others went to Plymouth, to
ascertain whether they claimed either of these places.
They were treated with respect at Plymouth, and were
informed, that Sowams was claimed by that colony, but
that Aquetneck was out of their jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c009'>They returned to Providence, and on the 7th of March,
1637–8, the following instrument was drawn up, and signed
by nineteen individuals, all but two of whom were named
in the act to disarm certain citizens of Massachusetts:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We, whose names are underwritten, do swear, solemnly,
in the presence of Jehovah, to incorporate ourselves into a
body politic, and as he shall help us, will submit our persons,
lives and estates unto our Lord Jesus Christ, the King
of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and to all those most perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>and absolute laws of his, given us in his holy word of truth,
to be guided and judged thereby.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>By the friendly assistance of Mr. Williams, Aquetneck
and other islands in the Narraganset Bay, were purchased
of the sachems, Canonicus and Miantinomo, on consideration
of forty fathoms of white beads. The deed of cession
was signed by the sachems, March 24, 1637–8.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c010'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>The natives who resided at Aquetneck soon after agreed,
on receiving ten coats and twenty hoes, to remove before
the next winter.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c010'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>On the beautiful island, the adventurers commenced
their settlement, under the simple compact which we have
quoted. The northern part of the island was first occupied,
and called Portsmouth. The number of the colonists
being increased during the summer, a portion of the inhabitants
removed the next spring, to the southwestern part
of the island, where they commenced the town of Newport.
Both towns, however, were considered as belonging
to the same colony. In imitation of the form of government
which existed for a time among the Jews, the inhabitants
chose Mr. Coddington to be their magistrate, with the title
of Judge; and a few months afterwards, they elected three
elders,<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c010'><sup>[181]</sup></a> to assist him. This form of government continued
till March 12, 1640, when they chose Mr. Coddington,
Governor; Mr. Brenton, Deputy Governor; and Messrs.
Easton, Coggeshall, William Hutchinson, and John Porter,
assistants; Robert Jefferies, Treasurer, and William Dyer,
Secretary. This form of government continued, till the
charter was obtained. The fertility of the soil, and the
pleasantness of the climate, soon attracted many people to
the settlement, and the island in a few years became so
populous, as to send out colonists to the adjacent shores.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c010'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>To this settlement, Mr. Hutchinson, with his family,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>removed from Massachusetts. There is no evidence that
Mrs. Hutchinson occasioned any disturbance at Rhode-Island.
Her husband was elected one of the assistants, in
1640. He died in 1642, and his wife, for some reason not
satisfactorily explained, removed to the neighborhood of
New-York, where she was killed by the Indians, the next year,
with all the members of her family, amounting to sixteen
persons, except one daughter, who was carried into captivity.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is proper to mention in this place, with special honor
the important aid of Mr. Williams in founding this settlement.
With that prompt humanity, which always distinguished
him, he used all his influence on behalf of this
band of exiles; and it was, without question, his intimacy
and favor with the sachems which procured the cession of
Aquetneck. He himself asserted this fact, in a letter
written in 1658:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have acknowledged (and have and shall endeavor to
maintain) the rights and properties of every inhabitant of
Rhode-Island in peace; yet since there is so much sound
and noise of purchase and purchasers, I judge it not
unseasonable to declare the rise and bottom of the planting
of Rhode-Island in the fountain of it. It was not price
nor money that could have purchased Rhode-Island.
Rhode-Island was obtained by love; by the love and favor
which that honorable gentleman, Sir Henry Vane, and
myself, had with that great sachem Miantinomo, about the
league which I procured between the Massachusetts English,
&amp;c. and the Narragansets, in the Pequod war. It is
true, I advised a gratuity to be presented to the sachem
and the natives; and because Mr. Coddington and the rest
of my loving countrymen were to inhabit the place, and to
be at the charge of the gratuities, I drew up a writing in
Mr. Coddington’s name, and in the names of such of my
loving countrymen as came up with him, and put it into as
sure a form as I could at that time (amongst the Indians)
for the benefit and assurance of the present and future
inhabitants of the island. This I mention, that as that
truly noble Sir Henry Vane hath been so great an instrument
in the hand of God for procuring of this island from
the barbarians, as also for procuring and confirming of the
charter, so it may by all due thankful acknowledgment be
remembered and recorded of us and ours, which reap and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>enjoy the sweet fruits of so great benefits, and such unheard
of liberties amongst us.” Backus, vol. i. p. 91.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In another manuscript,” (says Mr. Benedict, vol. i. p.
459) he tells us, “The Indians were very shy and jealous
of selling the lands to any, and chose rather to make a
grant of them to such as they affected; but at the same
time, expected such gratuities and rewards as made an
Indian gift oftentimes a very dear bargain.” “And the
colony in 1666,” says Mr. Callender, “averred, that though
the favor Mr. Williams had with Miantinomo was the great
means of procuring the grants of the land, yet the purchase
had been dearer than of any lands in New-England.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams’ conduct on this occasion was worthy of
his character, and entitled him to more gratitude than he
seems to have received from some of the objects of his
good offices.</p>

<p class='c009'>About this time, a number of the inhabitants of Providence,
among whom was Mr. Benedict Arnold, removed to
Pawtuxet, a place four miles south of Providence, and
included within the territory ceded to Mr. Williams.
These individuals were doubtless induced to fix their residence
there, by the luxuriant meadows on the banks of the
river, which furnished pasture for their cattle.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Condition of Providence—execution of three murderers of an Indian—birth
of Mr. Williams’ eldest son.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have seen Mr. Williams, though burdened by the
toils and privations of a new settlement, generously devoting
his time and property to rescue his countrymen from
destruction by the Pequods; and assisting to establish a
new colony at Rhode-Island. His own settlement at
Providence was, in the mean while, increasing. The
measures adopted in Massachusetts, in relation to Mrs.
Hutchinson and her adherents, made Providence a welcome
place of refuge to some of the fugitives. The temper
of Massachusetts towards the settlement is shown in an act
of the General Court, March 12, 1637–8, virtually prohibiting
any of the inhabitants of Providence from coming into
Massachusetts.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c010'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This act operated with much severity, for the colonists
were dependent on Boston for supplies from abroad. Mr.
Williams complained, that he had suffered the loss of many
thousand pounds, in his “trading with English and natives,
being debarred from Boston, the chief mart and port
of New-England.”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c010'><sup>[184]</sup></a> The writer of the History of Providence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>attributes the want of written memorials of the first
settlers to the scarcity of paper, observing, that “the
first of their writings that are to be found, appear on small
scraps of paper, wrote as thick, and crowded as full as
possible.” This scarcity of an article, which could be
procured from Europe only, would be a natural consequence
of an exclusion from the only port nearer than
New-York, which vessels from abroad then visited. But
articles of still greater necessity could not be obtained in
the colonies, and the inconvenience, if not suffering, occasioned
by such an exclusion, can scarcely be imagined in
the present age.</p>

<p class='c009'>But no injuries to himself or his fellow colonists could
provoke Mr. Williams to refuse his good offices with the
Indians. About June, 1638, the following letter was written
by him to Governor Winthrop:<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c010'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir,</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perceive, by these your last thoughts, that you have
received many accusations and hard conceits of this poor
native Miantinomo, wherein I see the vain and empty puff
of all terrene promotions, his barbarous birth or greatness
being much honored, confirmed and augmented (in his
own conceit) by the solemnity of his league with the English,
and his more than ordinary entertainment, &amp;c. now
all dashed in a moment in the frowns of such in whose
friendship and love lay his chief advancement.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, of the particulars, some concerning him only,
some Canonicus and the rest of the sachems, some all the
natives, some myself.</p>

<p class='c016'>“For the sachems, I shall go over speedily, and acquaint
them with particulars. At present, let me still find this
favor in your eyes, as to obtain an hearing, for that your
love hath never denied me, which way soever your judgment
hath been (I hope, and I know you will one day see
it,) and been carried.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, let this barbarian be proud, and angry, and covetous,
and filthy, hating and hateful, (as ourselves have been
till kindness from heaven pitied us, &amp;c.) yet let me humbly
beg belief, that for myself, I am not yet turned Indian,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>to believe all barbarians tell me, nor so basely presumptuous
as to trouble the eyes and hands of such (and so
honored and dear) with shadows and fables. I commonly
guess shrewdly at what a native utters, and, to my remembrance,
never wrote particular, but either I know the bottom
of it, or else I am bold to give a hint of my suspense.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, therefore, in some things at present, (begging your
wonted gentleness toward my folly) give me leave to show
you how I clear myself from such a lightness.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I wrote lately (for that you please to begin with) that
some Pequods (and some of them actual murderers of the
English, and that also after the fort was cut off,) were now
in your hands. Not only love, but conscience forced me
to send, and speedily, on purpose, by a native, mine own
servant. I saw not, and spake not with Miantinomo, nor
any from him. I write before the All-Seeing Eye. But
thus it was. A Narraganset man (Awetipimo) coming
from the Bay with cloth, turned in (as they use to do) to
me for lodging. I questioned of Indian passages, &amp;c.
He tells me Uncas was come with near upon forty natives.
I asked what present he brought. He told me that Cutshamoquene
had four fathom and odd of him, and forty was
for Mr. Governor. I asked him how many Pequods. He
told me six. I asked him if they were known. He said
Uncas denied that there were any Pequods, and said they
were Mohegans all. I asked if himself knew any of them.
He answered he did, and so did other Indians of Narraganset.
I asked if the murderer of whom I wrote, Pamatesick,
were there. He answered he was, and (I further
inquiring) he was confident it was he, for he knew him as
well as me, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c016'>“All this news (by this providence) I knew before ever it
came to Narraganset. Upon this I sent, indeed fearing
guilt to my own soul, both against the Lord and my countrymen.
But see a stranger hand of the Most and Only
Wise. Two days after, Uncas passeth by within a mile of
me (though he should have been kindly welcome.) One
of his company (Wequaumugs) having hurt his foot, and
disabled from travel, turns in to me; whom lodging, I
question, and find him by father a Narraganset, by mother
a Mohegan, and so freely entertained by both. I further
inquiring, he told me he went from Mohegan to the Bay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>with Uncas. He told me how he had presented forty
fathom (to my remembrance) to Mr. Governor (four and
upwards to Cutshamoquene,) who would not receive them,
but asked twice for Pequods. At last, at Newton, Mr.
Governor received them, and was willing that the Pequods
should live, such as were at Mohegan, subject to the English
sachems at Connecticut, to whom they should carry
tribute, and such Pequods as were at Narraganset to Mr.
Governor, and all the runaways at Mohegan to be sent
back. I asked him how many Pequods were at Narraganset.
He said but two, who were Miantinomo’s captives,
and that at Niantick with Wequash Cook were about three
score. I asked, why he said the Indians at Narraganset
were to be the Governor’s subjects. He said, because
Niantick was sometimes so called, although there hath been
of late no coming of Narraganset men thither. I asked
him if he heard all this. He said that himself and the
body of the company stayed about Cutshamoquene’s. I
asked how many Pequods were among them. He said six.
I desired him to name them, which he did thus: Pametesick,
Weeaugonhick, (another of those murderers)
Makunnete, Kishkontuckqua, Sausawpona, Qussaumpowan,
which names I presently wrote down, and (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pace vestra
dixerim</span>) I am as confident of the truth as that I breathe.
Again, (not to be too bold in all the particulars at this
time) what a gross and monstrous untruth is that concerning
myself, which your love and wisdom to myself a little
espy, and I hope see malice and falsehood, (far from the
fear of God) whispering together? I have long held it
will-worship to doff and don to the Most High in worship;
and I wish also, that in civil worship, others were as far
from such a vanity, though I hold it not utterly unlawful
in some places. Yet surely, amongst the barbarians (the
highest in the world,) I would rather lose my head than so
practise, because I judge it my duty to set them better
copies, and should sin against my own persuasions and
resolutions.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, concerning the islands Prudence and (Patmos, if
some had not hindered) Aquetneck, be pleased to understand
your great mistake: neither of them were sold properly,
for a thousand fathom would not have bought either,
by strangers. The truth is, not a penny was demanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>for either, and what was paid was only gratuity, though I
chose, for better assurance and form, to call it sale.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And, alas! (though I cannot conceive you can aim at
the sachems) they have ever conceived that myself and Mr.
Coddington (whom they knew so many years a sachem at
Boston) were far from being rejected by yourselves, as you
please to write, for if the Lord had not hid it from their
eyes, I am sure you had not been thus troubled by myself
at present. Yet the earth is the Lord’s and the fulness
thereof. His infinite wisdom and pity be pleased to help
you all, and all that desire to fear his name and tremble at
his word in this country, to remember that we are all
rejected of our native soil, and more to mind the many
strong bands, with which we are all tied, than any particular
distastes each against the other, and to remember that
excellent precept, Prov. 25, If thine enemy hunger, feed
him, &amp;c. for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,
and Jehovah shall reward thee; unto whose mercy and
tender compassions I daily commend you, desirous to be
more and ever,</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, mine own and wife’s respective salutes to your dear
companion and all yours; as also to Mr. Deputy, Mr.
Bellingham, and other loving friends.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am bold to enclose this paper, although the passages
may not be new, yet they may refresh your memories in
these English Scotch distractions, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c016'>“For his much honored and beloved Mr. Governor of
Massachusetts, these.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In August, 1638, his aid was again solicited by Massachusetts.
Winthrop says, under that date, “Janemoh, the
sachem of Niantick, had gone to Long-Island, and rifled
some of those Indians which were tributaries to us. The
sachems complained to our friends of Connecticut, who
wrote us about it, and sent Captain Mason, with seven men,
to require satisfaction. The Governor of the Massachusetts
wrote also to Mr. Williams, to treat with Miantinomo
about satisfaction, or otherwise to bid them look for war.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Upon this Janemoh went to Connecticut, and made his
peace, and gave full satisfaction for all injuries.”<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c010'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>About this time, an event occurred, which deserves to be
related, both on account of Mr. Williams’ connection with
it, and because it is in a high degree honorable to the
justice and integrity of the colonists, in their transactions
with the natives.</p>

<p class='c009'>Four young men, of Plymouth, who were servants,
having absconded from their masters, attacked an Indian,
at Pawtucket, near Providence, but within the limits of
Plymouth colony. After inflicting upon him a mortal
wound, they robbed him of a quantity of wampum, and
fled to Providence. Here they were received by Mr. Williams,
with his usual hospitality, he being then ignorant of
their character and their crime, and supposing that they
were, as they pretended, travellers to Connecticut. He
furnished them with letters and a guide; but after their
departure, he was informed of the atrocious act which they
had perpetrated. He immediately despatched messengers
to apprehend them, and went himself, with two or three
others, in search of the wounded Indian. They carried
him to Providence, and endeavored to preserve his life;
but in vain. The murderers fled to Newport, where, in
consequence of information from Mr. Williams, they were
arrested. Mr. Coddington being absent, they were sent to
Providence. Mr. Williams was at a loss to determine,
whether they ought to be tried at Newport, where they
were taken, or at Plymouth, to which they belonged. He
accordingly wrote to Governor Winthrop, to ask his advice.
The following letter, written about August, 1638, contains,
among other things, an account of these transactions:<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c010'><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Much honored Sir,</p>

<p class='c016'>“The bearer lodging with me, I am bold to write an
hasty advertisement concerning late passages. For himself,
it seems he was fearful to go farther than forty miles about
us, especially considering that no natives are willing to
accompany him to Pequod or Mohegan, being told by two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Pequods (the all of Miantinomo’s captives which are not run
from him) what he might expect, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, Capt. Mason and Thomas Stanton, landing at
Narraganset, and at Miantinomo’s denouncing war within
six days against Janemoh, for they say that Miantinomo hath
been fair in all the passages with them, Janemoh sent two
messengers to myself, requesting counsel. I advised him to
go over with beads and satisfy, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He sent four Indians. By them Mr. Haynes writes me,
that they confess fifteen fathom there received at Long-Island.
Thereabout they confessed to me (four being taken
of Pequods by force, and restored again,) as also that the
islanders say fifty-one fathom, which sum he demanded, as
also that the Niantick messengers laid down twenty-six
fathom and a half, which was received in part, with declaration
that Janemoh should within ten days bring the rest
himself, or else they were resolved for war, &amp;c. I have
therefore sent once and again to Janemoh, to persuade himself
to venture, &amp;c. Canonicus sent a principal man last
night to me, in haste and secrecy, relating that Wequash
had sent word that if Janemoh went over he should be killed,
but I assure them the contrary, and persuade Canonicus to
importune and hasten Janemoh within his time, ten days,
withal hoping and writing back persuasions of better things
to Mr. Haynes, proffering myself, (in case that Janemoh
through fear or folly fail) to take a journey and negotiate
their business, and save blood, whether the natives’ or my
countrymen’s.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, there hath been great hubbub in all these parts,
as a general persuasion that the time was come of a
general slaughter of natives, by reason of a murder committed
upon a native within twelve miles of us, four days
since, by four desperate English. I presume particulars
have scarce as yet been presented to your hand. The last
5th day, toward evening, a native, passing through us,
brought me word, that at Pawtucket, a river four miles from
us toward the Bay, four Englishmen were almost famished.
I sent instantly provisions, and strong water, with invitation,
&amp;c. The messengers brought word, that they were
one Arthur Peach, of Plymouth, an Irishman, John Barnes,
his man, and two others come from Pascataquack, travelling
to Connecticut; that they had been lost five days, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>fell into our path but six miles. Whereas they were importuned
to come home, &amp;c. they pleaded soreness in
travelling, and therefore their desire to rest there.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The next morning they came to me by break of day,
relating that the old man at Pawtucket had put them forth
the last night, because that some Indians said, that they
had hurt an Englishman, and therefore that they lay
between us and Pawtucket.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I was busy in writing letters and getting them a guide
to Connecticut, and inquired no more, they having told me,
that they came from Plymouth on the last of the week in
the evening, and lay still in the woods the Lord’s day, and
then lost their way to Weymouth, from whence they lost
their way again towards us, and came in again six miles off
Pawtucket.</p>

<p class='c016'>“After they were gone, an old native comes to me and
tells me, that the natives round about us were fled, relating
that those four had slain a native, who had carried three
beaver skins and beads for Canonicus’ son, and came home
with five fathom and three coats; that three natives which
came after him found him groaning in the path; that he
told them that four Englishmen had slain him. They
came to Pawtucket and inquired after the English, which
when Arthur and his company heard, they got on hose and
shoes and departed in the night.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I sent after them to Narraganset, and went myself with
two or three more to the wounded in the woods. The
natives at first were shy of us, conceiving a general slaughter,
but, (through the Lord’s mercy) I assured them that
Mr. Governor knew nothing, &amp;c. and that I had sent to
apprehend the men. So we found that he had been run
through the leg and the belly with one thrust. We dressed
him and got him to town next day, where Mr. James and
Mr. Greene endeavored, all they could, his life; but his
wound in the belly, and blood lost, and fever following, cut
his life’s thread.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Before he died, he told me, that the four English had
slain him, and that, (being faint and not able to speak) he
had related the truth to the natives who first came to him,
viz. that they, viz. the English, saw him in the Bay and
his beads; that sitting in the side of a swamp a little way
out of the path (I went to see the place, fit for an evil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>purpose) Arthur called him to drink tobacco, who coming
and taking the pipe of Arthur, Arthur run him through the
leg into the belly, when, springing back, he, Arthur, made
the second thrust, but missed him, and his weapon run into
the ground; that getting from them a little way into the
swamp, they pursued him, till he fell down, when they
missed him, and getting up again, when he heard them
close by him, he run to and again in the swamp, till he fell
down again, when they lost him quite; afterwards, towards
night, he came and lay in the path, that some passenger
might help him as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Whereas they said, they wandered Plymouth way,
Arthur knew the path, having gone it twice; and besides
Mr. Throckmorton met them about Naponset river in the
path, who, riding roundly upon a sudden by them, was glad
he had past them, suspecting them. They denied that
they met Mr. Thockmorton.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The messenger that I sent to Narraganset, pursuing after
them, returned the next day, declaring that they showed
Miantinomo’s letters to Aquetneck (which were mine to
Connecticut) and so to Aquetneck they past, whither I sent
information of them, and so they were taken. Their sudden
examination they sent me, a copy of which I am bold
to send your worship enclosed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The islanders (Mr. Coddington) being absent, resolved
to send them to us, some thought, by us to Plymouth, from
whence they came. Sir, I shall humbly crave your judgment,
whether they ought not to be tried where they are
taken. If they be sent any where, whether not to Plymouth.
In case Plymouth refuse, and the islanders send

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“This native, Will, my servant, shall attend your

<p class='c016'>“My due respect to Mr. Deputy, Mr. Bellingham, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Governor Winthrop advised him to send the prisoners to
Plymouth. He complied, and three of them (the fourth having
effected his escape) were there tried for murder. They
confessed the crime, and were hung at Plymouth, in the
presence of Mr. Williams, and many of the natives. Two
died penitents, especially Arthur Peach, an Irishman, “a
young man (says Governor Winthrop) of good parentage
and fair condition, and who had done very good service
against the Pequods.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The following letter of Mr. Williams belongs to this
period. It was addressed to Governor Winthrop:<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c010'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Much honored Sir,</p>

<p class='c016'>“Through the mercy of the Most High, I am newly
returned from a double journey to Connecticut and Plymouth.
I shall presume on your wonted love and gentleness,
to present you with a short relation of what issue it
pleased the Lord to produce out of them, especially since
your worship’s name was in some way engaged in both.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I went up to Connecticut with Miantinomo, who had a
guard of upwards of one hundred and fifty men, and many
sachems, and his wife and children with him. By the way
(lodging from his house three nights in the woods) we met
divers Narraganset men complaining of robbery and violence
which they had sustained from the Pequods and
Mohegans, in their travel from Connecticut; as also
some of the Wunnashowatuckoogs (subject to Canonicus)
came to us and advertised, that two days before, about six
hundred and sixty Pequods, Mohegans and their confederates,
had robbed them, and spoiled about twenty-three fields
of corn, and rifled four Narraganset men amongst them;
and also that they lay in way and wait to stop Miantinomo’s
passage to Connecticut, and divers of them threatened to
boil him in a kettle.</p>

<p class='c016'>“This tidings being many ways confirmed, my company,
Mr. Scott, (a Suffolk man,) and Mr. Cope, advised our
stop and return back; unto which I also advised the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>whole company, to prevent bloodshed, resolving to get up
to Connecticut by water, hoping there to stop such courses.
But Miantinomo and his council resolved, (being then
about fifty miles, half way, on our journey,) that not a man
should turn back, resolving rather all to die, keeping strict
watch by night, and in dangerous places a guard by day
about the sachems, Miantinomo and his wife, who kept the
path, myself and company always first, and on either side
of the path forty or fifty men to prevent sudden surprisals.
This was their Indian march.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But it pleased the Father of mercies, that (as we since
heard) we came not by, till two days after the time given
out by Miantinomo, (by reason of staying for me until the
Lord’s day was over) as also the Lord sent a rumor of great
numbers of the English, in company with the Narragansets,
so that we came safe to Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Being arrived, Uncas had sent messengers that he was
lame, and could not come. Mr. Haynes said it was a lame
excuse, and sent earnestly for him, who at last came,
and being charged by Mr. Haynes with the late outrages,
one of his company said, they were but an hundred men.
He said he was with them, but did not see all was done,
and that they did but roast corn, &amp;c. So there being
affirmations and negations concerning the number of men
and the spoil, not having eye-witnesses of our own, that fell,
as also many other mutual complaints of rifling each other,
which were heard at large to give vent and breathing to
both parts.</p>

<p class='c016'>“At last we drew them to shake hands, Miantinomo and
Uncas, and Miantinomo invited (twice earnestly) Uncas to
sup and dine with him, he and all his company (his men
having killed some venison;) but he would not yield,
although the magistrates persuaded him also to it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In a private conference, Miantinomo, from Canonicus
and himself, gave in the names of all the Pequod sachems
and murderers of the English. The names of the sachems
were acknowledged by Uncas, as also the places, which
only I shall be bold to set down:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nausipouck, Puttaquappuonckquame his son, now on
Long-Island.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nanasquiouwut, Puttaquappuonckquame his brother, at
Mohegan.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“Puppompogs; Sassacus his brother, at Mohegan.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mausaumpous, at Niantick.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Kithansh, at Mohegan.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Attayakitch, at Pequod or Mohegan.</p>

<p class='c016'>“These, with the murderers, the magistrates desired to
cut off, the rest to be divided, and to abolish their names.
An inquisition was made, and it was affirmed from Canonicus,
that he had not one. Miantinomo gave in the
names of ten or eleven, which were the remainder of near
seventy, which at the first subjected themselves, of which I
advertised your worship, but all again departed or never
came to him; so that two or three of these he had with
him; the rest were at Mohegan and Pequod.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Uncas was desired to give in the names of his. He answered,
that he knew not their names. He said, there were
forty on Long-Island; and that Janemoh and three Niantick
sachems had Pequods, and that he himself had but twenty.
Thomas Stanton told him and the magistrates, that he dealt
very falsely; and it was affirmed by others, that he fetched
thirty or forty from Long-Island at one time. Then he acknowledged,
that he had thirty, but the names he could not
give. It pleased the magistrates to request me to send to
Niantick, that the names of their Pequods might be sent to
Connecticut; as also to give Uncas ten days to bring in the
number and names of his Pequods and their runaways, Mr.
Haynes threatening also (in case of failing) to fetch them.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, at Plymouth, it pleased the Lord to force the prisoners
to confess, that they all complotted and intended
murder; and they were, three of them, (the fourth having
escaped, by a pinnace, from Aquetneck,) executed in the
presence of the natives who went with me. Our friends
confessed, that they received much quickening from your
own hand. O that they might also in a case more weighty,
wherein they need much, viz. the standing to their present
government and liberties, to which I find them weakly
resolved.</p>

<p class='c016'>“They have requested me to inquire out a murder five
years since committed upon a Plymouth man, (as they now
hear) by two Narraganset Indians, between Plymouth and
Sowams. I hope, (if true) the Lord will discover it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I understand there hath been some Englishman of
late come over, who hath told much to Cutshamoquene’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Indians (I think Auhaudin) of a great sachem in England,
(using the King’s name) to whom all the sachems in this
land are and shall be nothing, and where his ships ere long
shall land; and this is much news at present amongst the
natives. I hope to inquire out the man.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Vane hath also written to Mr. Coddington and
others on the island of late, to remove from Boston, as
speedily as they might, because some evil was ripening, &amp;c.
The most holy and mighty One blast all mischievous buds
and blossoms, and prepare us for tears in the valley of tears,
help you and us to trample on the dunghill of this present
world, and to set affections and cast anchor above these
heavens and earth, which are reserved for burning.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I hear, that two malicious persons, (one I was bold
to trouble your worship with not long since) Joshua Verin,
and another yet with us, William Arnold, have most falsely
and slanderously (as I hope it shall appear) complotted together
(even as Gardiner did against yourself) many odious
accusations in writing. It may be, they may some way
come to your loving hand. I presume the end is to render
me odious both to the King’s Majesty, as also to yourselves.
I shall request humbly your wonted love and gentleness (if
it comes to your worship’s hand) to help me with the sigh
of it, and I am confident yourself shall be the judge of the
notorious wickedness and malicious falsehoods contained
therein, and that there hath not passed aught from me, either
concerning the maintaining of our liberties in this land, or

<p class='c016'>“All respective salutations to kind Mrs. Winthrop, Mr.
Deputy, Mr. Bellingham, and theirs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In September, 1638, Mr. Williams’ eldest son was born,
to whom his father gave the name of Providence. He is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>said to have been the first English male child, who was born
there.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may here appropriately mention, the establishment of
Harvard College. The great and good men who presided
over the councils of Massachusetts felt, that learning and
religion are the firmest pillars of civil liberty. In their
weakness, they resolved to establish a college. In October,
1636, during the Pequod war, the General Court
appropriated for the purpose, four hundred pounds, equal
to the whole sum raised by taxation, in one year, in the
whole colony, for the support of the civil government. Rev.
John Harvard, who died September 14, 1638, left to the
college nearly eight hundred pounds, being half of his
property. The General Court gave to the college his
honored name, and called that part of Newtown where it
had been erected, Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the year, 1638, the colony at New-Haven was
commenced, by Theophilus Eaton, John Davenport, and
others, who purchased the land of the Indians, and laid
the foundation of the city of New-Haven. The colony
bore the same name, until 1665, when it was united with
that which had been commenced at Hartford, and assumed
the common name of Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c009'>In May, of this year, an arbitrary order was issued in
England, to prevent emigration to America. Eight ships,
which were on the point of sailing for New-England, were
stopped. By this order, Oliver Cromwell, Sir Arthur Hazlerig,
John Hampden, and others, were prevented from
coming to America. The King had afterwards abundant
reason to lament his interference to detain these men, who
so largely contributed to subvert his throne.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c010'><sup>[190]</sup></a> It is a matter
of curious speculation, what would have been the course
and fortunes of Cromwell, if he had reached our shores.

the next fifty years.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Baptism of Mr. Williams—establishment of the First Baptist Church
in Providence—Mr. Williams soon leaves the church.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having related the principal facts, which can now be
ascertained, concerning the settlement of Providence and
Newport, it is proper to say something of ecclesiastical affairs.
We must lament, in vain, that so little is known
on this subject. We have no account, from Mr. Williams
or his friends, of the manner in which the public worship
of God was maintained, and the first church formed at
Providence. The notices which may be gleaned from
writers, who, for various reasons, were not disposed to look
on the new colony with a favorable eye, must, obviously, be
received with caution.</p>

<p class='c009'>We might be sure, from the known character of Mr.
Williams, and of his companions, that they would meet together
for the public worship of God. Mr. Williams was
acknowledged, at Plymouth and Salem, to be an able minister,
and he would, of course, preach to those who might
choose to hear him, at Providence. We learn from Winthrop,<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c010'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
that he was accustomed to hold meetings, both on
the Sabbaths, and on week days. It does not appear, that
there was, at first, any organization into a distinct church;
though, perhaps, those who had been members of the church
in Salem, regarded themselves as still a church, and Mr.
Williams as their pastor.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c010'><sup>[192]</sup></a> They were, at first, few in
number, and were obliged to provide dwellings and subsistence
for themselves and their families. They were not
able to erect a house of worship, and tradition states, that
in pleasant weather they met in a grove. On other occasions,
they probably convened, either at the house of Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Williams, or at some other private habitation; and, undoubtedly,
enjoyed, in their humble assemblies, the presence
of Him, who is nigh to all who fear Him, and who prefers
“above all temples, the upright heart and pure.”<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c010'><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>It should be remembered, that the colony was a refuge
for all who pleased to reside there; and that, as Winthrop
states, “at their first coming, Mr. Williams and the rest did
make an order, that no man should be molested for his conscience.”
The inhabitants were consequently free to worship
God as they thought proper. They were not all united
in opinion on religious subjects. Mr. Williams may have
judged it to be most conducive to the peace and welfare of
his little colony, to erect, at first, no distinct church, but
to gather the inhabitants into one assembly for worship;
until the number should have so increased, as to enable
them to form separate churches, and maintain public worship
conformably to their own views.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the lapse of two or three years, the colony had increased,
by the accession of emigrants from England, as
well as from the other colonies. Some of these are said by
Hubbard, (336) to have been inclined to the principles of the
Baptists. By what means Mr. Williams’ mind was drawn
to a consideration of baptism, we do not know. He was
accused, before his banishment, of preaching doctrines
“tending to anabaptistry;”<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c010'><sup>[194]</sup></a> a charge which was meant to
impute to him principles subversive of civil order, rather
than heterodox notions concerning the rite of baptism. It
does not appear, that he had then adopted any views on
this point, opposed to the practice of the churches in Massachusetts;
for if he had then insisted on immersion, and rejected
the baptism of infants, these opinions would certainly
have been placed prominently among the reasons for his
banishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>That his principles tended to “anabaptistry,” using this
word as referring to the principles now held by the Baptists,
is doubtless true. His views of the distinction between the
Mosaic institutions and the christian church; his reverence
for the supreme authority of Jesus Christ; his appeals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>to the Scriptures as the only rule of faith and practice, and
to the New Testament as the statute book of the Christian
church; his assertion and defence of the independent right,
and imperative obligation, of every individual to search the
oracles of God, and follow their teachings, without dictation
or restraint from other men; his bold and uniform proclamation
of the unfettered liberty of conscience, in those concerns
which pertain to the intercourse between God and
the soul, will doubtless be acknowledged by the Baptists,
to have had a strong tendency to lead Mr. Williams to adopt
their distinctive views of the Christian ordinances.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor will it be considered, by other men, as a very strange
vagary of an unstable mind, that a clergyman, educated
in the Church of England, should adopt the opinion, that
immersion is the only scriptural baptism, when that church
had taught him, in her offices, that baptism must be so administered,
except in cases of weakness or disease. Nor
ought Mr. Williams to be severely censured for denying
that infants are proper subjects of this ordinance, when it
is recollected, that the first President of Harvard University,
(Dunster,) held the same opinion; and the second
President (Chauncy) so far followed in the same course, as
to insist, that baptism should be administered, to infants and
adults, by immersion only.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c010'><sup>[195]</sup></a> Mr. Williams will, at least, be
viewed as excusable, by those who agree with a learned
Pedobaptist of our own times, that “it is a plain case, there is
no express precept respecting infant baptism in our sacred
writings.”<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c010'><sup>[196]</sup></a> If Mr. Williams could not find infant baptism
in the Scriptures, his rejection of it was a natural result of
his principles, and may candidly be ascribed to his single-hearted
deference to the authority of the Bible; though his
reputation for ingenuity may suffer, because he was unable
“to make out the proof in another way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We are not, therefore, reduced to the necessity of adopting
Governor Winthrop’s account of Mr. Williams’ change
of opinion. That account attributes the blame to an
artful woman, a sister of the great heresiarch of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>times, Mrs. Hutchinson.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c010'><sup>[197]</sup></a> We may, not unreasonably, suppose,
that Mr. Williams, on further study of the Scriptures,
and finding that several of the colonists had embraced Baptist
principles, was himself convinced, that he had not been
baptized. He accordingly resolved to obey the Saviour’s
command, and unite in a church, with such persons as
might be willing to join him.</p>

<p class='c009'>A difficulty now presented itself. They had been educated
in the Episcopal church, and were accustomed to
regard the clergy with respect, as the only legal administrators
of the Christian ordinances. Mr. Williams himself
seems to have strongly felt this difficulty; and his scruples
on this point, probably, had some effect on his subsequent
conduct. He had not himself been immersed, and it seemed
a reasonable conclusion, that he could not, with propriety,
baptize his brethren, till he had received baptism. There
was no other minister in New-England, who would have
baptized him, if he had made an application, and his banishment
from Massachusetts had been suspended.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most obvious expedient, in their circumstances, was
adopted. Mr. Ezekiel Holliman<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c010'><sup>[198]</sup></a> was selected to baptize
Mr. Williams, who then baptized the administrator and ten
others.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c010'><sup>[199]</sup></a> This event occurred in March, 1638–9. Thus
was founded the first Baptist church in America, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>second, as it is stated, in the British empire.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c010'><sup>[200]</sup></a> The church
was soon after increased by the addition of twelve other
persons.</p>

<p class='c009'>The validity of this baptism of Mr. Williams and his
companions having been disputed, it may be proper to examine
this point.</p>

<p class='c009'>The spirit of the Scriptures, if not their letter, assigns to
the ministers of the Gospel the duty of administering the
ordinances of the church. Expediency obviously requires
an adherence to this general principle. But the language
of the Bible is not so decisive on this point, as to make it
certain, that a layman might not, in cases where a minister
could not be obtained, administer the ordinances. It is
known, that in the earliest ages of the church, while there
was a general observance of the principle, that the administration
of the ordinances belongs to ministers, laymen were
occasionally permitted to baptize. Mosheim says: “At
first, all who were engaged in propagating Christianity, administered
this rite; nor can it be called in question, that
whoever persuaded any person to embrace Christianity,
could baptize his own disciple.”<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c010'><sup>[201]</sup></a> Tertullian says, “Laymen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>have power to baptize, which yet, for the sake of
order, they ought only to use in cases of necessity.”<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c010'><sup>[202]</sup></a> Ambrose
says: “That at the beginning, laymen were permitted
to preach and baptize, in order to increase the number of
Christians.”<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c010'><sup>[203]</sup></a> Augustine affirms, “that it is a very small
fault, or none at all, for laymen to baptize, in cases of urgent
necessity.”<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c010'><sup>[204]</sup></a> Jerome speaks of it as a thing certain,
that “laymen may lawfully baptize, when there is urgent
necessity for it.”<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c010'><sup>[205]</sup></a> There were, it is true, at a very early
period, erroneous views of the indispensable necessity of
baptism to salvation, which led to various unauthorized
practices. But the principle, that laymen might lawfully
baptize, in certain exigencies, seems to have been early admitted,
and it was formally sanctioned by a decree of the
Council of Eliberis.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c010'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>But the reason of the case is of more weight than the decisions
of councils. It sometimes happens, that persons
become Christians, without the direct labors of a minister.
If, for example, by the agency of the Scriptures and tracts,
which missionaries are now sending into the Chinese empire,
a number of persons in a neighborhood should become
converts, would it not be their privilege and their
duty, if they were sufficiently instructed respecting the nature
of the church and of its ordinances, to appoint one of their
number to baptize the rest, to form themselves into a church,
and to partake of the Lord’s Supper? Must these believers
wait, till a missionary could come to baptize them, and to
organize a church? The great ends for which the church
and its ordinances were appointed,—the spiritual edification
of believers, and the spread of truth,—would require that
these Christians should enjoy them. If it were indispensable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>that the administrator be a minister, there would, in
such a case, be no insuperable difficulty. The duty of the
converts to assemble, to pray, and to exhort each other,
would be clear. Their voluntary agreement thus to meet,
to maintain mutual watchfulness, and to enjoy the ordinances
of the Gospel, would constitute them a church.
They might call one of their number, possessing, in their
judgment, suitable gifts, to the office of the ministry, and this
election by the church would be the only human sanction
which such a minister would need, to authorize him to preach
the Gospel, and to administer the ordinances.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c010'><sup>[207]</sup></a> This position
cannot be denied, without resorting to the doctrine of a
regular apostolical succession. If the church has no power
to originate a ministry, by investing with the sacred office
those to whom, in her judgment, the Saviour has given the
inward vocation, the ministry might become extinct. Those
who insist on an apostolical succession, are obliged to trace
their ministry through the channel of the papal clergy.
They are forced to admit, that the Pope is a true bishop, and
the Catholic community a Christian church. Archbishop
Laud confessed, that “it is through her that the bishops of the
Church of England, who have the honor to be capable of
deriving their calling from St. Peter, must deduce their succession.”<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c010'><sup>[208]</sup></a>
If the race of English prelates had become extinct,
as might have happened, had Cromwell’s life been prolonged
a few years, the Church of England would have been
reduced to the embarrassing dilemma, of consecrating bishops
by her own authority, and thus dissolving the charm of
succession, or of sending an humble embassy to Rome, to
crave from his Holiness the communication, anew, of the
mysterious virtue.</p>

<p class='c009'>If, then, a company of believers in China might, in accordance
with the spirit of the New Testament, appoint an
administrator of the ordinances, the little band of Baptists
at Providence were fully authorized to do it.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c010'><sup>[209]</sup></a> No minister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>could have been obtained, in America, to baptize Mr. Williams.
The case was one of obvious necessity, and the
validity of the baptism cannot be denied, without rejecting
the fundamental principle, on which dissenting churches
rest, that all the ecclesiastical power on earth resides ultimately
in the church, and that she is authorized to adopt
any measures, not repugnant to the Scriptures, which may
be necessary for her preservation and prosperity. Whatever
the New Testament has positively prescribed, must of
course be strictly obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>In regard to those whom Mr. Williams baptized, there
can be no dispute. He was a clergyman of the Church of
England, and Pedobaptists must admit, that immersion, administered
by him, was Christian baptism. Their own
ministers not unfrequently administer the rite in this manner,
and the persons thus baptized are received as regular
members of their churches.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c010'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>At what time, and under what circumstances, Mr. Williams
left the church, has been a vexed question among
writers. Callender, (p. 56,) expresses a doubt, whether
Mr. Williams ever belonged to the church, and adds: “The
most ancient inhabitants now alive, some of them above
eighty years old, and who personally knew Mr. Williams,
and were well acquainted with many of the original settlers,
never heard that Mr. Williams formed the Baptist church
there, but always understood, that Mr. Brown, Mr. Wickenden,
Mr. Dexter, Mr. Olney, Mr. Tillinghast, &amp;c. were
the first founders of that church.” But Mr. Callender was
under a mistake, and, according to Mr. Backus,<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c010'><sup>[211]</sup></a> he was
afterwards convinced of his error. The records of the
church, as quoted by Mr. Benedict (vol. i. p. 476,) assert,
that “Mr. Williams held his pastoral office about four years,
and then resigned the same to Mr. Brown and Mr. Wickenden,
and went to England, to solicit the first charter.”
This statement, also, is incorrect.</p>

<p class='c009'>Winthrop (vol. i. p. 307,) says, under the date of June
or July, 1639: “At Providence, matters went on after the
old manner. Mr. Williams and many of his company a few
months since were in all haste re-baptized; and denied
communion with all others; and now he was come to question
his second baptism, not being able to derive the authority
of it from the apostles, otherwise than by the ministers
of England, (whom he judged to be ill authority) so
as he conceived God would raise up some apostolic power.
Therefore he bent himself that way, expecting (as was supposed)
to become an apostle; and having a little before refused
communion with all, save his own wife, now he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>preach to and pray with all comers. Whereupon some of
his followers left him and returned back from whence they
went.”</p>

<p class='c009'>According to this paragraph, Mr. Williams left the church
about three or four months after its formation. This fact
is confirmed by a letter of Richard Scott, inserted in George
Fox’s “Firebrand Quenched.” Scott says of Roger
Williams, “I walked with him in the Baptist way, about
three or four months, in which time he broke from the society,
and declared at large the grounds and reason of it,
that their baptism could not be right, because it was not
administered by an apostle. After that, he set up a way of
seeking with two or three that had dissented with him, by
way of preaching and praying; and there he continued a
year or two, till two of the three left him.”<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c010'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Scott was at Providence, when the church was
formed, and there can be no doubt, that he soon became a
member of it, though he afterwards joined the Quakers.
The “three or four months” which he mentions must, on
this supposition, be estimated as commencing at, or near,
the formation of the church, and consequently Mr. Williams
must have left it in June or July, 1639, as Winthrop states.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of his reasons for this step, we are not clearly informed.
The motives assigned by those who disapproved his conduct,
are loosely stated, and must be received with caution.
The principal reason, as stated by Winthrop, Scott, and
others, was, that Mr. Williams doubted the validity of the
baptism which he and his associates had received, because
it was not “administered by an apostle,” or because he
could not “derive the authority of it from the apostles,
otherwise than by the ministers of England, whom he judged
to be ill authority.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of Mr. Williams’ real views at this time, we have no explanation
by himself; but if we may judge from his writings
a few years later, he denied, that any ministry now
exists, which is authorized to preach the Gospel to the impenitent,
or to administer the ordinances. He believed,
that these functions belonged to the apostolic race of ministers,
which was interrupted and discontinued, when the
reign of Antichrist commenced, and which will not, as he
thought, be restored, till the witnesses shall have been slain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>and raised again. (Rev. 11: 11.) In his “Bloody Tenet,”
printed in 1644, several passages occur, in which he
intimates, that the true church and ministry are now lost.
The following paragraph may be quoted, both as an illustration
of his views and as a proof of his liberal charity:
He speaks of “thousands and ten thousands, yea, the whole
generation of the righteous, who, since the falling away
(from the first primitive Christian state or worship) have
and do err fundamentally concerning the true matter, constitution,
gathering and governing of the Church; and yet
far be it from any pious breast to imagine, that they are not
saved, and that their souls are not bound up in the bundle
of eternal life.”—(p. 20.) He says, in his “Hireling Ministry
none of Christ’s,” published in 1652: “In the poor
small span of my life, I desired to have been a diligent and
constant observer, and have been myself many ways engaged,
in city, in country, in court, in schools, in universities,
in churches, in Old and New England, and yet cannot,
in the holy presence of God, bring in the result of a satisfying
discovery, that either the begetting ministry of the
apostles or messengers to the nations, or the feeding and
nourishing ministry of pastors and teachers, according to
the first institution of the Lord Jesus, are yet restored and
extant.” (p. 4.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The only ministry, which, in his opinion, now exists, is
that of prophets, i. e. ministers, who explain religious truths,
and bear witness against error. In a passage of the same
work, he says: “Ever since the beast Antichrist rose, the
Lord hath stirred up the ministry of prophecy, who must
continue their witness and prophecy, until their witness be
finished, and slaughters, probably near approaching, accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We shall have occasion to disclose his opinions more
fully in a subsequent chapter. The passages which we
have quoted were not printed till a few years after he left
the church, but there can be no doubt, that they explain
his conduct on that occasion. His mind, like the minds
of many other good men, became blinded “by excess of
light,” while gazing at the glorious visions of the Apocalypse;
and he formed the conclusion, that in the disastrous
antichristian apostacy, the true ministry and the whole exterior
organization of the church went to ruin, from which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>however, as he believed, they shall be restored, and the
Saviour’s kingdom shall come on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>We need not pause, now, to show, that his views were
erroneous. We must deeply regret, that he formed them;
but we can have no doubt of his sincerity. A temperament
like his impelled him to hasty decisions, but his love of truth
held a supreme sway over his mind. No considerations
could deter him from adopting, and carrying into instant
practice, whatever he believed to be true. Nothing but
clear conviction could induce him to relinquish what he
considered as right. His principle of action on this subject
is beautifully expressed in a passage of his Bloody Tenet:
“Having bought truth dear, we must not sell it cheap, not
the least grain of it, for the whole world; no not for the
saving of souls, though our own most precious, least of all
for the bitter sweetening of a little vanishing pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We may conclude, then, that he left the church, not because
he had any doubts respecting the nature of baptism;
nor because he had been baptized by a layman; but because
he believed, that no man is now authorized to administer
the ordinances, and that no true church can exist, till the
apostolic ministry shall be restored. With these views, he
could not conscientiously remain connected with any
church, nor regard his baptism as valid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Winthrop states, that he expected, “as was <em>supposed</em>, to
become an apostle.” This supposition is not entitled to
much weight. It is certain, however, that he believed the
restoration of the church and its ministry to be not far distant,
and he might reasonably hope, should he live to witness
this glorious event, to be honored with a vocation to
this high ministry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The statement of Winthrop, that “having a little before
refused communion with all, <em>save his own wife</em>, now he
would preach to and pray with all comers,” deserves a passing
remark. The phrase, “a little before,” apparently refers
to the time of Mr. Williams’ residence at Salem. But
Morton, (p. 153) and Hubbard, who copies him, (p. 207)
assert, that “he withdrew all private religious communion
from any that would hold communion with the church there;
insomuch as he would not pray nor give thanks at meals
<em>with his own wife</em>, nor any of his family, because they went
to the church assemblies.” Here Winthrop’s statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>respecting Mr. Williams’ wife is directly opposed to that of
Morton and Hubbard. It is probable, that they were all
under a mistake.</p>

<p class='c009'>The disputed point, whether Mr. Williams was the first
pastor of the church, or not, does not appear to present a
material difficulty. He would, we may suppose, as a matter
of course, be the pastor of the church while he remained
in connection with it. He was the only ordained minister
at Providence, and though there may have been no formal
election, we cannot reasonably doubt, that he was considered
as the pastor. Richard Scott accuses him, in his letter,
of a disposition to manage every thing according to his own
pleasure; a charge, which, coming from an adversary, may
imply no more than that Mr. Williams was the head of the
church. When he left it, he ceased, of course, to be its
pastor. He was succeeded by the Rev. Chad Brown, though
not, as it appears, till after an interval of two years; for the
records of the church assert, that he was not ordained till
the year 1642.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c010'><sup>[213]</sup></a> We may easily suppose, that as Mr. Williams’
connection with the church was very short, Mr. Brown
was considered as the first pastor, even by his contemporaries,
and that this impression was transmitted to their descendants.
It was not unnatural, moreover, for the church to
be willing to recognise Mr. Brown as the first pastor, rather
than a man who soon left them, and who refused to acknowledge
them, or any other body of men, to be a true
church. It is possible, that other causes had some influence
in the case. It is certain, however, that Mr. Brown
has been generally believed to have been the first pastor of
the church.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c010'><sup>[214]</sup></a> He was, unquestionably, the first regular and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>permanent pastor, and may be regarded as one of the chief
founders. It is not probable that he contended for the
honor while he lived, and we may be sure that there was
no strife, on this point, between him and Roger Williams,
who speaks of him, in a letter written in 1677, as “a wise
and godly soul, now with God.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We have thus stated the facts, concerning Mr. Williams’
conduct, so far as we have been able to ascertain them.
We see that he acted from erroneous views, in leaving the
church, and we lament that he was thus misled into a course
injurious to religion and to his own spiritual welfare. But
we see nothing which impeaches his religious character;
and his future life furnished abundant evidence of his piety
towards God, and of his love to men. He adopted no errors,
except his views respecting the ministry and the organization
of the church. The great truths of the Gospel he
steadfastly believed. His life exhibited their efficacy, and
his heart felt their consoling power.</p>

<p class='c009'>The church continued in existence, after Mr. Williams
left it. The statement of Richard Scott, that “<em>he broke
from the society</em>,” implies, that the society itself or church
remained. The Rev. Chad Brown became its pastor, and
a succession of good men have continued to labor for the
Lord, in that church, till the present day. The church has
experienced some of the usual vicissitudes to which all
things on earth are liable; but it has never ceased to exist,
and for the most part it has enjoyed great prosperity.</p>

<p class='c009'>No meeting-house was built till about 1700, when the
Rev. Pardon Tillinghast, the pastor, erected a house at his
own expense.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c010'><sup>[215]</sup></a> This long delay to build a meeting-house
may be, in part, explained, by the poverty of the inhabitants,
and by the diversity of religious opinions which prevailed
among them. But we can scarcely acquit the
church of some deficiency in zeal and liberality. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>must presume, however, that they had a stated place of
worship. Their numbers were, at this period, small, and
they had, perhaps, sufficient humility to be content with
very primitive accommodations. To Him whom they worshipped,
the sincere offerings of pious hearts were acceptable,
however humble the place from which they ascended.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the religious doctrines of this church, Mr. Benedict
(vol. i. p. 486) says: “It was first formed on the Particular
or Calvinistic plan. In process of time, they became
what our English brethren would call General Baptists,
and so continued for the most part more than a hundred
years. From the commencement of Dr. Manning’s ministry,
they have been verging back to their first principles,
and now very little of the Arminian leaven is found among
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These facts show, that Mr. Cotton and his grandson,
Cotton Mather, were mistaken, when they affirmed of the
church at Providence, that they “broke forth into anabaptism,
and then into antibaptism and familism, and now
finally into no church at all.”<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c010'><sup>[216]</sup></a> Perhaps Mr. Cotton would
not acknowledge, that the congregation of Baptists at Providence
deserved the name of a church. Mr. Williams and
his wife, with several others of the members, were excommunicated
from the church at Salem, of which they were
retained as members till they were baptized.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c010'><sup>[217]</sup></a> A Baptist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>church, thus constituted, could not be viewed with much
favor by Mr. Cotton and his friends. A church, which
was formed this year at Newport, though Congregational
in form, and orthodox, it is presumed, in its doctrines,
is mentioned, in a tone of censure, by Winthrop,
and after him, by Hubbard, (339) as having been gathered
in a “very disordered way, for they took some excommunicated
persons, and others who were members of the
church of Boston, and not dismissed.”<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c010'><sup>[218]</sup></a> The leaders,
both in church and state, in Massachusetts, were not then
in a mood to be pleased with any thing which occurred in
Rhode-Island. It would have been well if this feeling had
expired with the first age. But local prejudice is almost
as durable as the natural features of a country. Bœotia
incurred, among the Greeks, a contempt, which the fame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>of Pindar, Hesiod and Epaminondas could not soften.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c010'><sup>[219]</sup></a>
Nazareth seems to have acquired a similar distinction
among the Jews.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c010'><sup>[220]</sup></a> Rhode-Island may regret, yet cannot
greatly wonder, that her sisters have sometimes remembered
the circumstances of her origin, better than the purity
of her principles and the steadiness of her patriotism.
Many, since Mr. Cotton, have been inclined to doubt,
whether there was any true religion in Rhode-Island, and
to believe, with Winthrop, that there was no good government.
But let her not be moved. Time is brightening
the fame of her founder, and the reflected lustre will attract
the eyes of men to a fairer contemplation of her character.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Affairs of the Indians—birth of Mr. Williams’ fourth child—disputes
at Providence about boundaries—Committee of Arbitration—account
of Samuel Gorton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Little is known of transactions, during two or three
subsequent years, which can shed light on the conduct or
character of Mr. Williams. Winthrop<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c010'><sup>[221]</sup></a> mentions one circumstance,
that shows the confidence which the Indians reposed
in the founder of Rhode-Island, and the invincible
opposition to him that was maintained in Massachusetts.
Rumors were circulated, that the Indians were again
forming plots against the colonists; that Miantinomo, the
Narraganset sachem, had sent a large present of wampum
to the Mohawks, inviting them to an alliance against the
English, and that the Mohawks had complied with the invitation.
The government of Massachusetts took the precaution
to strengthen the military defences of the towns,
and to send an officer, with three men and an interpreter,
to Miantinomo, to ascertain his real dispositions. He denied
all hostile intentions against the colonists, and, says
Winthrop, “promised to come to Boston (as he was desired)
if Mr. Williams might come with him, (but that we had
denied.”)</p>

<p class='c009'>It is pleasing to observe the readiness of this savage
chief to visit those who evidently distrusted him, provided
that Mr. Williams might accompany him, in whose knowledge
of his language, and firm friendship, he felt a confidence
proportioned to the suspicions which savages feel
towards all whom they have not thoroughly tried. And it
is remarkable, that the rulers of Massachusetts would not
relax the sentence of banishment, even for the advantage
of a personal interview with the powerful sachem.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams was doubtless employed at Providence, in
labors for the welfare of the colony, and for the subsistence
of his family. He possessed no property, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>obliged to support his wife and children by his personal
labor. We have already seen, that, at his first coming, he
planted his field, <em>Whatcheer</em>, with his own hands. He engaged,
also, in traffic with the natives, and must have spent
much time in travelling among them. The knowledge of
their language, which he displayed in his Key, published a
few years afterwards, could have been acquired only by a
familiar and frequent intercourse with them, in their own
habitations. He assures us, in his preface, that, “of later
times, (out of desire to attain their language,) I have run
through varieties of intercourses with them, day and night,
summer and winter, by land and sea. Many solemn discourses
I have had with all sorts of nations of them, from
one end of the country to another.”<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c010'><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>His fourth child, Marcy, was born on the 15th of July,
1640.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tranquillity of the town of Providence was early
disturbed, by disputes respecting the boundaries of lands.
The town was divided into two settlements, the original
one at Moshassuck, and that on the Pawtuxet river. These
two communities were much agitated, at various times, by
dissensions concerning their respective limits. The loose
phraseology of the memorandum attached to the deed of
the sachems, “up the streams of Pawtucket and Pawtuxet,
without limits, we might have for our use of cattle,”
was construed, by some, as a cession of the land up to the
sources of the streams; while Roger Williams, more reasonably,
insisted, that the Indians merely meant to allow
the cattle to feed occasionally on the banks of the rivers.
Of this dispute we shall see more hereafter. It seems to
have commenced very early, and to have seriously disturbed
the peace of the town. It became evident that a more
energetic government was necessary. A committee was
appointed by the town, consisting of Robert Coles, Chad
Brown, William Harris, and John Warner, who were authorized
to decide, by arbitration, the existing disputes.
Their report is dated “Providence, the 27th of the 5th
month, in the year (so called) 1640.”<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c010'><sup>[223]</sup></a> It settles the
boundaries between the Pawtuxet purchasers and the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>inhabitants of Providence. It proposes that five men be
chosen, to meet once a month, to dispose of lands, with a
right of appeal to the town. It further recommends, that
disputes be settled, in future, by arbitration, according to
certain rules which it prescribes. It provides for the
choice of a town clerk, and for a general town meeting for
business, to be called by the clerk, every three months.</p>

<p class='c009'>This report is highly characteristic of the times, and of
the community. One of its prominent articles is in these
words: “We agree, as formerly hath been the liberties of
the town, so still, to hold forth liberty of conscience.”
This fundamental principle was recognised, and announced,
on all occasions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The democratic spirit appears in the provision, that the
“five disposers” should present their accounts every quarter,
and a new choice be made.</p>

<p class='c009'>No form of government could be more simple than this.
Mr. Callender says, (p. 43) in allusion to this period, that
the inhabitants of Providence “did, to the number of near
forty persons, combine in a form of civil government, according
to a model drawn up by some of themselves, as
most suitable to promote peace and order in their present
circumstances, which, however, left them in a very feeble
condition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The government on Rhode-Island was more regularly
organized the same year, as we have already stated. An
act, which was passed on the 16th of March, 1641, says:
“It was ordered, and unanimously agreed upon, that the
government which this body politic doth attend unto in
this island and the jurisdiction thereof, in favor of our
Prince, is a Democracy, or popular government, that is to
say, it is in the power of the freemen, orderly assembled,
or major part of them, to make or constitute just laws, by
which they will be regulated, and to depute from among
themselves such ministers as shall see them faithfully executed
between man and man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The genuine Rhode-Island doctrine is recognised in the
following act: “It was further ordered, by the authority
of this present Court, that none be accounted a delinquent
for doctrine, provided it be not directly repugnant to the
government or laws established.” And on the 17th of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>September following, 1641, they passed this act: “It is
ordered, that that law of the last Court, made concerning
liberty of conscience in point of doctrine, be perpetuated.”<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c010'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>It thus appears, that the settlements at Providence, and
on Rhode-Island, though, at that time, having no political
connection, were founded on the same principles. Mr.
Williams continued his friendly offices with the Indians, on
behalf of the colony on Rhode-Island. On the 19th of
September, 1642, he was requested “to consult and agree
with Miantinomo, for the destruction of the wolves that are
now upon the island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The history of Samuel Gorton is a prominent event
among the occurrences of this period. We cannot enter
into a minute detail of his conduct, his opinions, and his
sufferings; but a brief account of him is required, by his
connection with Mr. Williams.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Gorton was born in London, and came to Boston in
1636. Here, his religious opinions and conduct occasioned,
as we are told, much disturbance, and he removed to
Plymouth, in 1637. He there engaged in a controversy
with Mr. Smith, the pastor, who appealed to the civil
power. Gorton was summoned before a court in Plymouth,
at which he maintained his opinions with firmness, and, as
the court thought, with insolence. He was amerced in a
large fine, and banished, after having suffered, according
to some writers,<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c010'><sup>[225]</sup></a> corporal punishment. He removed to
Newport, on Rhode-Island, in June, 1638. There he remained
for a year or two; but he gave offence to the government,
and, as some authors assert,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c010'><sup>[226]</sup></a> he was imprisoned,
whipped, and banished from the island, probably in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>course of the year 1641. These transactions are not
vouched by very satisfactory evidence; and we know not,
admitting that they occurred, to whom the blame belongs,
or in what proportion it must be shared by Mr. Gorton and
his judges.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Newport, he proceeded to Providence, where, says
Hutchinson, “Roger Williams, with his usual humanity,
although he disliked his principles and behavior, gave him
shelter.” Mr. Williams, many years afterwards, publicly
averred,<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c010'><sup>[227]</sup></a> that he did not approve of Mr. Gorton’s principles;
but this disapprobation did not induce him to refuse
the rights of hospitality to the fugitive. He had himself
tasted of the same cup, and, like Dido, had been taught by
suffering to succor the miserable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Gorton, in January, 1641–2, purchased land at
Pawtuxet, in the south part of the territory then included
under the name of Providence, and within the limits of the
present town of Cranston. He was soon joined by a number
of persons, who were disfranchised at Newport, on
account, perhaps, of their attachment to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>A disturbance soon arose between Mr. Gorton’s friends
and the former inhabitants. The parties became so much
exasperated, that they proceeded to acts of violence and
bloodshed. Winthrop states, that “they came armed into
the field, each against the other, but Mr. Williams pacified
them for the present.” Mr. Williams could not but deplore
such a feud, in his infant colony, and, with the pacific
disposition which ever characterized him, he endeavored
to allay the tumult, and produce a reconciliation; but
his efforts were unsuccessful. The passions of the parties
were too strongly excited, to admit of any arbitration but
force. The government at Providence was then, as we
have seen, a simple compact; and the citizens being
divided in opinion and feeling, there was no superior power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>to control the disturbers of the public peace. In this exigency,
in November, 1641, some of the weaker party had
recourse to the strange, and, as it proved, most disastrous
expedient, of applying to the government of Massachusetts
for aid or counsel.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c010'><sup>[228]</sup></a> The country was beyond the limits
of Massachusetts, which could not interfere. “We answered
them,” says Winthrop,<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c010'><sup>[229]</sup></a> “that we could not levy
any war, without a General Court. For counsel, we told
them, that except they did submit themselves to some jurisdiction,
either Plymouth or ours, we had no calling or
warrant to interpose in their contentions, but if they were
once subject to any, then they had a calling to protect
them.”<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c010'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>The proposition to submit, either to Massachusetts or to
Plymouth, did not meet with a very prompt reception by
the aggrieved party at Pawtuxet. But, in September,
1642, four of them (William Arnold, Robert Cole, William
Carpenter, and Benedict Arnold,) appeared before the
General Court, at Boston, and yielded themselves and their
lands, to be governed and protected by Massachusetts.
They were accepted, and Winthrop acknowledges that
Massachusetts was desirous to spread her sway over the
whole of the rising colonies around the Narraganset Bay.
The right of these individuals to submit to the jurisdiction
of Massachusetts must be denied; for the territory had
been purchased by Mr. Williams, and sold to his companions
and others, with the evident design, and the implied,
if not express condition, that a new colony be established,
as a refuge from the laws of Massachusetts, as well as from
oppression elsewhere. To invite the extension of these
laws over any portion of the colony, was to defeat the purpose
of its settlement, and was, virtually, a violation of the
covenant which the settlers had subscribed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if these individuals had possessed the right to yield
allegiance to Massachusetts, their surrender could not
bind their fellow-citizens, and give to Massachusetts any
claim to obedience from Mr. Gorton, or any other inhabitant
of Providence. Yet Massachusetts immediately assumed
a jurisdiction over all the inhabitants of Providence.
In October, the Governor and three of the assistants
signed a warrant, requiring them to submit to Massachusetts<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c010'><sup>[231]</sup></a>
and commanding Mr. Gorton and his friends to
come to Boston, to answer to the complaints of Mr. Arnold
and his associates. To this summons a reply was returned,
dated November 20, and signed by Mr. Gorton and
eleven other persons, in which they denied the authority
of Massachusetts, and refused to obey.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c010'><sup>[232]</sup></a> This answer is
said to have been long, mystical, and contemptuous; but
the principle, which it maintained, was, indisputably,
sound.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Mr. Gorton, and his eleven friends, thought it prudent
to remove from Providence. They accordingly crossed
the Pawtuxet river, the southern boundary of the territory
purchased by Mr. Williams. They obtained from Miantinomo
the cession of a tract of country, called Shawomet,
afterwards named Warwick, for which they paid one hundred
and forty-four fathoms of wampum.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c010'><sup>[233]</sup></a> Here they
fixed their residence; but, if the object of their removal
was to escape the grasp of Massachusetts, they fared like
many others, who have fled from apparent into real danger.
Two Indian sachems, Pomham and Sochonocho, who lived
at Shawomet and Pawtuxet, claimed the territory as their
own, and went to Boston, in June, 1643, where they complained
of Mr. Gorton and his friends, as having taken
their lands from them. These sachems then made a surrender
of themselves, and of the lands which they claimed,
to Massachusetts, and promised fidelity, for themselves and
their descendants.</p>

<p class='c009'>It appears, however, that Miantinomo, as the greatest
and most powerful sachem, claimed the right to dispose of
the land.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c010'><sup>[234]</sup></a> Pomham himself had signed the deed; and he
and Sochonocho, as subordinate sachems, seem to have
had no authority to dispute the validity of the sale, or to
cede the territory to Massachusetts. Roger Williams, the
best authority on a question touching the usages of the Indians,
says, in a letter written several years afterwards, to
the General Court of Massachusetts, concerning this
transaction: “What was done was according to the law
and tenor of the natives, I take it, in all New-England and
America, viz. that the inferior sachems and subjects shall
plant and remove at the pleasure of the highest and supreme
sachems; and I humbly conceive, that it pleaseth
the Most High and Only Wise to make use of such a bond
of authority over them, without which they could not long
subsist in human societies, in this wild condition wherein
they are.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>These facts must be deemed a sufficient proof, that Mr.
Gorton and his friends had a fair title to the lands, or, at
least, that they must be acquitted of the charge of defrauding
the inferior sachems. But Massachusetts was
not destitute of the inclination, which all states have usually
possessed, to extend her authority. The submission of
these sachems gave her a plausible pretext; and her rulers
again summoned Gorton and his friends to appear at Boston,
informing them that they were within the jurisdiction
of Massachusetts. They again refused; and an armed
force of forty men was sent to Shawomet, who seized Mr.
Gorton and ten of his friends, and carried them to Boston,
where they were imprisoned. Their cattle were carried
away with them, their property otherwise injured or seized,
and their families left to the mercy of the Indians.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Boston, they were tried for their lives, not for any
specific civil crime, but on the general charge of being
enemies to true religion, and to civil authority. They were
saved from death, by a majority, it is said, of two votes
only. They were, nevertheless, sentenced to a severe punishment.
Mr. Gorton was ordered to be confined at
Charlestown, and the others in different towns. Each was
compelled to wear an iron chain, fast bolted round the leg,
and in this manner to labor. If they spoke to any person,
except an officer of church or state, they were to suffer
death. They were kept at labor during the winter, and
were then banished, from Massachusetts, and from the lands
at Shawomet, on pain of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Gorton, and two of his friends, afterwards went to
England, where they obtained an order from the Earl of
Warwick and the other commissioners of the plantations,
dated August 19, 1644, requiring Massachusetts not to
molest the settlers at Shawomet. Massachusetts reluctantly
complied, and Mr. Gorton and his followers occupied
their lands in quiet. Mr. Gorton lived to a great age.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c010'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>We have stated these proceedings at considerable
length, because they are connected with the history of
Mr. Williams. They exhibit strongly the temper of those
times. The conduct of Massachusetts none will now defend.
It was a manifest usurpation, and a cruel abuse
of power. It is a profitable example of the manifold
evils of erecting the civil government into a court of inquisition.
It was the alleged heresies and blasphemies
of Mr. Gorton and his friends, against which the edge
of this persecution was directed; and these unhappy
men narrowly escaped the fate which, a few years
later, befel the Quakers. The rulers and clergy of Massachusetts,
undoubtedly, thought that they were impelled
by an honest zeal for the purity of religion and the glory
of God. Their conduct proves, that a being so fallible as
man, is unfit to be intrusted with power over the conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is difficult to ascertain the true character and real
opinions of Mr. Gorton. If the statements of his opponents
could be safely received, we should view him as a
wild and turbulent fanatic. But we have seen much reason
to distrust the representations, which writers of that
age have furnished of Mr. Gorton, and others. He was,
unquestionably, a bold, zealous, eloquent man, of considerable
talents and learning, and easily exasperated, by opposition,
to stubborn and contumacious resistance. He
possessed the art of securing the firm attachment of his
friends; a proof that he possessed some virtues, besides
consistency of character. A competent authority, quoted
in a preceding page, has testified to the general purity of
his morals, and to the high estimation in which he was held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>by his fellow-citizens, as indicated by the fact, that, “from
the first establishment of government, he was almost constantly
in office.” As to his religious opinions, it is affirmed,
by the same authority, that “he spiritualized every
thing, and one would almost have thought that he had
taken the tour of Swedenborg.”<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c010'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>It is certain that Roger Williams disapproved Mr. Gorton’s
religious opinions, but did not consider them as dangerous,
or as impairing his civil rights.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c010'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Birth of Mr. Williams’ second son—league of the colonies—war between
the Narragansets and Mohegans—capture and death of
Miantinomo—Mr. Williams embarks for England.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have, in the account of Mr. Gorton, advanced beyond
other events which claim a notice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams’ second son, Daniel, was born February
13, 1642.</p>

<p class='c009'>The colonists were alarmed, in 1642, by reports of a
meditated design, among the Indians, of a general war.
The natives began to acquire the use of fire-arms, with
which, together with ammunition, they were supplied by
English and Dutch traders. Vigorous measures of defence
were accordingly adopted in the colonies. Connecticut
proposed to attack the Indians, but Massachusetts refused
to join in the war, on the ground that there was not sufficient
proof of hostile designs on the part of the Indians.
She, nevertheless, disarmed the natives within her limits.
Miantinomo came to Boston, and protested that he was
innocent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The year 1643 was made memorable in the history
of New-England, by the union of the colonies. On the
19th of May, articles of confederation were signed, at Boston,
by the Commissioners of Massachusetts, Connecticut,
New-Haven and Plymouth, by which these four colonies
formed a league, under the name of “the United Colonies
of New-England.” The preface to the articles explains
the objects of the confederation:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whereas we all came into these parts of America with
one and the same end and aim, namely, to advance the
kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to enjoy the liberties
of the Gospel in purity with peace; and whereas, by
our settling, by the wise providence of God, we are further
dispersed upon the sea-coasts and rivers than was at first
intended, so that we cannot, according to our desire, with
convenience communicate in one government and jurisdiction,
and whereas we live encompassed with people of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>several nations and strange languages, which hereafter
may prove injurious to us or our posterity; and forasmuch
as the natives have formerly committed sundry insolences
and outrages upon several plantations of the English, and
have of late combined themselves against us; and seeing,
by reason of the sad distractions in England, (which they
have heard of) and by which they know we are hindered
both from that humble way of seeking advice and reaping
those comfortable fruits of protection, which, at other times,
we might well expect; we, therefore, do conceive it our
bounden duty, without delay, to enter into a present consociation
among ourselves, for mutual help and strength in
all future concernment, that, as in nation and religion, so
in other respects, we be and continue one.”<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c010'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>By the articles, it was stipulated, that two commissioners
from each of the colonies should be chosen, to meet
annually, at Boston, Hartford, New-Haven and Plymouth,
in successive years, and that this Congress should determine
questions of peace or war, and consult for the general
welfare of the colonies. This league continued till
the year 1686. It had a beneficial effect, and was probably
the germ from which sprung the confederation, and
the subsequent union of the States, under our present happy
government. Rhode-Island was never allowed the honor
of an admission into the New-England confederacy. The
want of a charter was, at first, the pretext; but when the
charter was obtained, there was no more disposition than
before to forgive this offending sister, and admit her to the
privileges of the family compact. The second charter
itself was offensive to the other colonies, for it recognised,
as a fundamental principle, “a full liberty in religious concernments.”
The exclusion of Rhode-Island from the
confederacy exposed her to many inconveniences and
dangers. She was left without defence, except by her own
citizens, and a law of the New-England Congress virtually
forbad her to purchase arms and ammunition for her own
protection. But the influence of Mr. Williams among the
Indians preserved the colony from perils, to which the inexorable
aversion of her sister colonies had abandoned her.
It was happy for those colonies, that their conduct met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>with no retaliation, but that Mr. Williams and his colony
steadily employed their influence to appease the ire of the
savages, and to protect their countrymen.</p>

<p class='c009'>A war soon commenced between Miantinomo and Uncas,
the Mohegan sachem. In 1637, Miantinomo made
an agreement with the government of Massachusetts, not
to fight, without their consent, with any of the Indians,
and particularly not to invade Uncas. In the next year,
there was a tripartite agreement made at Hartford, between
Miantinomo, Uncas and the English, in which it
was stipulated, that those sachems should not make war
on each other, for any alleged injuries, without an appeal
to the English. In the spring of the year 1643, an attempt,
it was said, was made to assassinate Uncas, by a
Pequod Indian, one of his subjects, and it was suspected
that he was incited to this act by Miantinomo. Other
attempts, it is alleged, were made to take the life of Uncas,
and in the same year, the two sachems came to open war.
Miantinomo, with one thousand Narraganset warriors, attacked
Uncas, in August, 1643, but was defeated and
taken prisoner, though the force of Uncas was only three
or four hundred. Miantinomo had a coat of mail, or corslet,
with which, it has been said, without sufficient proof,
he was furnished by Mr. Gorton. Uncas carried his prisoners
to Hartford, at the suggestion of Mr. Gorton,<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c010'><sup>[239]</sup></a> who
wished to save his friend, and therefore wrote to Uncas,
threatening him with the resentment of the English, if he
did not surrender the captive.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Hartford, Miantinomo was imprisoned, and application
was made to the Commissioners of the United Colonies,
at their session at Boston, September, 1643, to determine
his fate. The Commissioners thought, that they
could neither release him with safety, nor justly put him to
death. But they called in to their aid “five of the most
judicious elders,”<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c010'><sup>[240]</sup></a> and these ministers of the Gospel soon
agreed, that the unhappy chief ought to die. This answer
was accordingly returned, and Miantinomo was delivered
to Uncas, who carried him within his own territories, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>there butchered him. The government at Hartford sent
twelve or fourteen soldiers with Uncas, as a guard to protect
him from the rage of the Narragansets.</p>

<p class='c009'>This transaction has been defended, on the grounds, that
Miantinomo was at the head of a general conspiracy
against the English, that he had violated the agreement
made at Hartford, and that he was of a turbulent spirit.
Other charges were alleged against him; but it is not easy
to convince a reader of the present day, that the death of
the sachem was either deserved or necessary. That the
ministers of the Gospel doomed him to death, while the
civilians could hesitate, is remarkable. It is another proof
of the danger of permitting the clerical and civil functions
to interfere with each other. The clergymen probably
treated the case of Miantinomo as a religious question.
These good men, we may fear, were misled by that propensity,
to which we have before alluded, to regard the
events of Jewish history as authoritative precedents. They,
perhaps, viewed Miantinomo as a heathen conspirator
against the people of God, and deemed him worthy of the
fate of Agag. But we turn away, with a sigh, from this
melancholy subject, by quoting the words of a distinguished
citizen of Providence.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c010'><sup>[241]</sup></a> “This was the end of Miantinomo,
the most potent Indian prince the people of New-England
had ever any concern with; and this was the reward
he received for assisting them, seven years before, in
their war with the Pequods. Surely a Rhode-Island man
may be permitted to mourn his unhappy fate, and drop a
tear on the ashes of Miantinomo, who, with his uncle Canonicus,
were the best friends and greatest benefactors the
colony ever had. They kindly received, fed and protected
the first settlers of it, when they were in distress, and were
strangers and exiles, and all mankind else were their enemies;
and, by this kindness to them, drew upon themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>the resentment of the neighboring colonies, and hastened
the untimely death of the young king.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But let us remember, that it is not easy to judge fairly
of the conduct of our fathers. We cannot feel, as they
did, the exigencies of their situation. They were weak,
and surrounded with powerful tribes, to whom rumor and
fear constantly attributed the design to unite in a general
conspiracy for the destruction of the English. Miantinomo
was suspected, probably without sufficient evidence, of an
ambitious purpose to be the head of such a league. The
colonists, perhaps, thought themselves justified, by the
right of self-preservation, in putting to death the aspiring
chief, before he could mature his plans, and execute his
purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must now return to Mr. Williams. The settlements
at Providence and on Rhode-Island had continued to increase,
for several years. They had hitherto been distinct,
but their principles and interests were so similar, that an
alliance as one colony became manifestly expedient. The
necessity of a charter, from the government of England,
was apparent, to protect them from the encroachments of the
other colonies, and to give a sanction and authority to their
government. A committee was appointed, at an assembly
in Newport, September 19, 1642, with instructions to procure
a charter. This committee intrusted the agency to
Mr. Williams, who, on behalf of that colony and his own,
agreed to visit England on this important errand.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c010'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>He accordingly left his family, and proceeded to Manhattoes,
(New-York) to embark for England. It would
have been more convenient and agreeable to sail from Boston,
but Mr. Williams was not permitted to enter the territories
of Massachusetts, notwithstanding the good service
which he had performed for them in their hour of need.
But at Manhattoes, he had an opportunity to use his influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>with the savages, and to display his pacific principles.
A war had been provoked, by the wanton cruelty of the
Dutch, and the Indians assailed them with great fury.
They burnt several houses in the neighborhood of Manhattoes,
and killed several persons, among whom was Mrs.
Hutchinson, with all but one of her family. The Indians
on Long-Island engaged in the war, and burnt several of
the Dutchmen’s houses. They assaulted the dwelling of
Lady Moody, who not long before had left Salem, in consequence
of her Baptist principles.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c010'><sup>[243]</sup></a> Mr. Williams immediately
interceded, and, by his mediation, the Indians were
pacified, and peace was restored between them and the
Dutch. This event, according to Winthrop, occurred in
June, 1643, and we thus learn the date of Mr. Williams’
first embarkation for England, which must have taken
place soon after.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Williams’ first visit to England—Key to the Indian languages—charter—birth
of Mr. Williams’ youngest child—Bloody Tenet—he
returns to America—reception at Boston and Providence—again
aids in preventing an Indian war.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some time during the summer of 1643, Mr. Williams
embarked at New-York for his native land. A Dutch ship
furnished him with a conveyance, which his own countrymen
had denied him. Of the length and incidents of the
voyage, we know nothing. The vessel, we may be sure,
did not afford the sumptuous accommodations, nor pursue
her course over the Atlantic with the celerity, of the packet
ships of the present day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams was not of a mood to be idle, either on the
land or on the ocean. He acted on the principle, so beautifully
expressed in one of his books, “one grain of time’s
inestimable sand is worth a golden mountain.” He has
told us, that he employed his leisure, during this voyage, in
preparing the materials of his Key to the Indian languages:
“I drew the materials, in a rude lump, at sea, as a private
help to my own memory, that I might not, by my present
absence, lightly lose what I had so dearly bought in some
few years’ hardship and charges among the barbarians.”<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c010'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This book, which is an honorable specimen of his talents
as a writer, his industry and acuteness in collecting the
words and phrases of an unwritten language, and his benevolent
zeal for the welfare of the Indians, must have
been nearly finished for the press during the voyage. It
was printed before the close of the year 1643, and we may
suppose, that after his arrival in England, his endeavors to
procure the charter, and other engagements, would leave
him little leisure for writing. Of this book we shall have
occasion to speak again, in a subsequent chapter, in which
we shall briefly review his literary character and writings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams arrived in England at a most critical period.
A civil war then convulsed the nation. The misguided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>King, Charles I., by a series of unjustifiable measures, repugnant
to the constitution, and in violation of his own
promises and oaths, had provoked an opposition, which
issued in a rupture and a bloody war. The King had fled
from London, and Parliament had assumed the executive
as well as legislative authority. The King and the Parliament
levied troops, the sword was unsheathed, and, after a
sanguinary struggle of several years, the unhappy Charles
died on the scaffold, Episcopacy was abolished, the monarchy
was overturned, and a commonwealth, under the
protectorship of Cromwell, was established on its ruins.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams arrived at an early period in this disastrous
conflict. Its issue was then very doubtful. The Episcopal
clergy, and a large portion of the aristocracy, were on the
side of the King. With these were joined many of the
quiet men of the kingdom, who, while they disapproved the
King’s conduct, were led by a sentiment of loyalty, and a
hope that he might be persuaded to a right course, to rally
around the monarch. The patriot would have been satisfied
with a guarantee for the rights of the people; and the
advocates of religious liberty would have been content with
toleration. But the inflexible obstinacy and arbitrary principles
of the King daily strengthened his enemies and
alienated his friends. It soon became evident, that the
King must yield, or the nation must submit to slavery. The
contest ended, as every struggle between despotism and
liberty, the rulers and the people, must, sooner or later,
terminate:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For Freedom’s battle, once begun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bequeath’d by bleeding sire to son,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though baffled oft, is ever won.”<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c010'><sup>[245]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The disturbed condition of the kingdom was, in some
respects, favorable to the objects of Mr. Williams. It disposed
the Parliament to strengthen themselves, by conciliating
the favor of their brethren in America. The House
of Commons, in March, 1642–3, passed a memorable resolve,
in favor of New-England, exempting its imports and
exports from customs, subsidy or taxation. In November,
1643, not long, we presume, after Mr. Williams’ arrival,
Parliament passed an ordinance, appointing the Earl of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Warwick Governor in Chief and Lord High Admiral of the
American colonies, with a council of five peers and twelve
commoners. It empowered him, in conjunction with his
associates, to examine the state of their affairs, to send for
papers and persons, to remove governors and officers, and
appoint others in their places, and to assign to these such
part of the power now granted as he should think proper.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c010'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>From these commissioners Mr. Williams easily obtained,
by the aid of Sir Henry Vane, one of their number, a charter
for the colony of Rhode-Island, dated March 14, 1643–4,
in which the most ample powers were granted to the inhabitants
to form and maintain a civil government.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c010'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>During Mr. Williams’ absence, his youngest child, Joseph,
was born, in December, 1643, according to Backus,
though his tombstone, now standing in the family graveyard,
in Cranston, (R. I.) bears an inscription, which
states that he was born in 1644.</p>

<p class='c009'>While in England, Mr. Williams, notwithstanding the
pressure of his duties, and the disturbed state of the public
mind, found leisure to prepare for the press his celebrated
book, entitled “The Bloody Tenet of Persecution for Cause
of Conscience, discussed in a conference between Truth
and Peace, who, in all tender affection, present to the
High Court of Parliament, as the result of their discourse,
these amongst other passages of highest consideration.”
In this book, which he dedicated to Parliament, and which
was doubtless read, with interest and profit, by many of the
leading men in England,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c010'><sup>[248]</sup></a> Mr. Williams discusses the
great principles of religious liberty, in answer to a letter of
the Rev. John Cotton. Mr. Cotton wrote a reply, to which,
in accordance with the humor of those times, he gave the
quaint and punning title of “The Bloody Tenet Washed,
and made White in the Blood of the Lamb.” Mr. Williams
published a rejoinder, with a title in the same strain,
“The Bloody Tenet yet more Bloody, by Mr. Cotton’s
Endeavor to Wash it White.” Of these books we shall
give some account, in a subsequent chapter. It may suffice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>now, to say, that Mr. Cotton’s argument rests on a sophistical
distinction between persecution for religious opinions,
and punishment for maintaining errors. He disclaims the
right to “persecute any for conscience rightly informed;”
but if a man possesses “an erroneous and blind conscience,
in fundamental and weighty points,” he ought, after suitable
admonition, to be punished by the civil magistrate, not
because he entertains heretical principles, but because he
is wilfully blind and criminally obstinate, in refusing to
believe what is clearly revealed in the Scriptures. It
seems surprising, that a man of Mr. Cotton’s abilities and
virtues, could seriously maintain so transparent an absurdity;
for if the magistrate be allowed to judge what is “an
erroneous and blind conscience,” he will decide according
to his own construction of the word of God, and will pronounce
all who differ from himself to be culpably obstinate,
and worthy of punishment. This is precisely the case in
every instance of persecution; and the Court of High
Commission, who expelled Mr. Cotton from England,
would have needed no other defence of their conduct than
his own arguments. But Mr. Cotton, though a great and
a good man, was misled by his views of the duty of the
civil magistrate to interfere, for the preservation of purity
in the Christian church, as the civil authorities were required
to guard the Jewish religion, and to smite, with
unsparing severity, those who renounced or corrupted it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams, in his book, exposes the fallacy of Mr.
Cotton’s arguments; and by cogent reasoning and acute
expositions of various texts, he establishes this fundamental
principle, as alike taught by the Scriptures and by reason,
that men are not responsible to each other for their religious
opinions, and ought not to suffer molestation, or injury,
in their persons or property, for those opinions, nor for
the actions by which they are expressed and maintained,
unless the civil peace is disturbed. In this case, their
conduct ceases to be a matter of religious concern merely,
and comes within the cognizance of the civil magistrate.
Mr. Williams is very clear and decided on this point.
Though he was accused as a turbulent contemner of magistracy
and civil order, yet in this book, printed within
a few years after his banishment, he says, “I speak not
of scandals against the civil state, <em>which the civil state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>ought to punish.</em>”<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c010'><sup>[249]</sup></a> This book is written with great ability,
it shows learning and taste, and it breathes a tone of courtesy
which was not common at that time, and which would
not dishonor this age.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams returned to America, in the autumn of
1644. He landed at Boston, September 17. He was emboldened
to venture on this forbidden ground, by the following
letter from several noblemen and other members of
Parliament, addressed “To the Right Worshipful the Governor
and Assistants, and the rest of our worthy friends in
the plantation of Massachusetts Bay, in New-England:”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Our much honored friends:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Taking notice some of us of long time of Mr. Roger
Williams’ good affections and conscience, and of his sufferings
by our common enemy and oppressors of God’s people,
the prelates, as also of his great industry and travels in his
printed Indian labors, in your parts, (the like whereof we
have not seen extant from any part of America) and in
which respect it hath pleased both Houses of Parliament
to grant unto him, and friends with him, a free and absolute
charter of civil government for those parts of his abode,
and withal sorrowfully resenting, that amongst good men
(our friends) driven to the ends of the world, exercised
with the trials of a wilderness, and who mutually give good
testimony, each of the other, (as we observe you do of him,
and he abundantly of you,) there should be such a distance;
we thought it fit, upon divers considerations, to profess our
great desires of both your utmost endeavors of nearer
closing and of ready expressing those good affections,
(which we perceive you bear to each other) in effectual
performance of all friendly offices. The rather because of
those bad neighbors you are likely to find too near you in
Virginia, and the unfriendly visits from the west of England
and from Ireland. That howsoever it may please the
Most High to shake our foundations, yet the report of your
peaceable and prosperous plantations may be some refreshings
to your true and faithful friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This letter procured for Mr. Williams permission to proceed
unmolested to Providence, but it produced no relaxation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>of the policy of Massachusetts towards him. Mr.
Hubbard (p. 349) says: “Upon the receipt of the said letter,
the Governor and magistrates of the Massachusetts found,
upon examination of their hearts, they saw no reason to
condemn themselves for any former proceedings against
Mr. Williams; but for any offices of Christian love, and
duties of humanity, they were very willing to maintain a
mutual correspondency with him. But as to his dangerous
principles of separation, unless he can be brought to lay
them down, they see no reason why to concede to him, or
any so persuaded, free liberty of ingress and egress, lest
any of their people should be drawn away with his erroneous
opinions.” The aversion to Mr. Williams’ principles,
both religious<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c010'><sup>[250]</sup></a> and political, was not abated by his
return with a charter, which invested the heretical colony
with the dignity of an independent government, and armed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>her with the shield of the parent state. Her example became,
thenceforth, more dangerous; and the united colonies
steadily pursued towards her an unfriendly policy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams’ return to Providence was greeted by a
voluntary expression of the attachment and gratitude of its
inhabitants, which is one of the most satisfactory testimonies
to his character. They met him at Seekonk, with
fourteen canoes, and carried him across the river to Providence.
This simple act of respect must have been highly
grateful to his feelings. It does equal honor to him, and
to his fellow citizens, who thus showed themselves capable
of estimating, in a manner worthy of freemen, the services
of a friend and public benefactor.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c010'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>We may suppose, that Mr. Williams, after his return,
immediately endeavored to carry into operation the charter
which he had procured with so much labor and expense.
But it was a work which required time, to bring the inhabitants
of the several settlements at Providence, Newport,
Portsmouth and Warwick, to agree on a form of government,
and unite as one colony. The charter prescribed
no form of civil polity, and it was accordingly necessary to
manage the negotiations between the towns with much
delicacy and skill.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the mean time, Mr. Williams had another opportunity
to interpose his beneficent agency in favor of the colonists.
The Narraganset Indians, exasperated by what they judged
to be the murder of their favorite sachem, Miantinomo,
were bent on vengeance, with the unrelenting ferocity of
savages. They alleged, that they had paid wampum, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the amount of forty pounds, as a ransom for the chieftain’s
life. They therefore resolved on war with the Mohegans,
until they should obtain the head of Uncas. The commissioners
of the colonies, at their meeting in Hartford, in
September, 1644, appeased their animosity for a while, the
Narraganset sachems promising not to commence hostilities
against Uncas until after the next planting time, and
likewise after thirty days’ notice to the government of Massachusetts
and Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c009'>The commissioners, this year, passed an act, forbidding
any person to sell any kind of arms or ammunition to an
Indian, or to repair any weapon for him, under a heavy
penalty. This measure was called for by the rapid progress
of the Indians in the use of fire-arms. The law had,
it is probable, some effect, but like similar laws in regard
to the Indians, in later times, unprincipled men found many
ways to evade it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Narragansets soon commenced the war, and killed
several of the Mohegans. An extraordinary meeting of
the commissioners was held in Boston, in July, 1645, when
it was judged necessary to send messengers to the sachems
of the Narragansets and Mohegans, requiring them to suspend
hostilities and come to Boston. The messengers
were informed by the Narragansets, that they were resolved
on war. They accordingly returned to Boston, with
a letter from Mr. Williams, informing the government,
that the Narragansets would soon commence hostilities
against the colonists, except at Providence and Rhode-Island,
the Indians having, from regard to Mr. Williams,
agreed to maintain a neutrality with these settlements.</p>

<p class='c009'>The commissioners immediately resolved to raise a force
of three hundred men,<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c010'><sup>[252]</sup></a> to march immediately for the protection
of the Mohegans. A part of the levy from Massachusetts
marched accordingly. Two messengers were
again sent to the Narraganset sachems, with directions to
take Mr. Benedict Arnold with them as their interpreter.
But they could not find Mr. Arnold at Providence, and
learned that he dared not venture among the Indians without
a guard. But Mr. Williams had been sent for by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>sachems, doubtless to advise them in this crisis. The messengers,
therefore, solicited his aid, and he served them as
an interpreter. By his mediation, Passacus,<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c010'><sup>[253]</sup></a> the sachem,
and other chief men, were persuaded to go to Boston,
where a treaty was concluded between the commissioners
and the sachems, by which the latter agreed to make peace
with Uncas, and to pay the colonists two thousand fathoms
of wampum, at different times, as a remuneration for their
expenses in the war. This treaty was concluded in August,
1645, and the sachems left a child of Passacus, a
child of his brother, and two other children of persons of
note, as a security for the faithful performance of the
treaty.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c010'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Thus was New-England saved, a second time, from a
general Indian war, by means, in no small part, of the
good offices of Mr. Williams. The small English army
was disbanded, and the 4th of September was observed, by
the colonists, as a day of thanksgiving to God. This
measure was worthy of our pious ancestors. We may hope,
that while they justly ascribed the praise of their deliverance
to God, they felt some emotions of gratitude towards
their exiled benefactor.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Letters to John Winthrop—organization of the government—vote
of money to Mr. Williams—agreement of several inhabitants of
Providence—dissentions—Indian troubles.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have now the pleasure of presenting the first of a
number of unpublished letters, addressed to John Winthrop,
the son of Governor Winthrop, of Massachusetts.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c010'><sup>[255]</sup></a>
Mr. Winthrop resided, for several years, at Nameug, or
Pequod, now New-London, in Connecticut. It appears
from one of the letters, that Mr. Williams became acquainted
with him in England; and the correspondence
which we shall introduce, will show that the friendship was
strong and mutual. We cannot stay to offer comments on
the letters. They relate to politics, literature, agriculture,
and various other topics, while religion is diffused, like a
grateful fragrance, through them all.</p>

<p class='c009'>This and other letters are dated at Narraganset, or Cawcawmqussick,
(now North-Kingstown,) where Mr. Williams,
about this time, purchased an estate, and built a
trading house, which he afterwards sold, to obtain money
for his second visit to England.</p>

<p class='c016'>“For his honored, kind friend, Mr. John Winthrop, at
Pequod, these.</p>

seen divers papers, (returning now yours thankfully,)
which are snatched from me again. I have, therefore,
been bold to send you the Medulla and the Magnalia
Dei. Pardon me, if I request you, in my name, to transfer
the paper to Captain Mason, who saith he loves me.
God is love; in him only I desire to be yours ever,</p>

<p class='c016'>“Loving salutes to your dearest and kind sister.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have been very sick of cold and fever, but God hath
been gracious to me. I am not yet resolved of a course
for my daughter. If your powder, with directions, might
be sent without trouble, I should first wait upon God in
that way: however, it is best to wait on him. If the ingredients
be costly, I shall thankfully account. I have
books that prescribe powders, &amp;c. but yours is probatum in
this country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We know little of the condition of Providence at this
time. We may presume, however, that it continued to
flourish. It is stated, that about this period, there were,
in Providence and its vicinity, one hundred and one men,
fit to bear arms.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c010'><sup>[257]</sup></a> This fact indicates a large increase of
population, in a period of less than ten years.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a considerable lapse of time, the inhabitants of
Providence, Portsmouth, Newport, and Warwick, agreed
on a form of civil government. This form, says Mr.
Backus, provided for the election of “a President and four
Assistants annually, who had the executive power, were
judges in the courts of law and kept the peace. An Assembly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>of six commissioners, or representatives, from each
town, made laws, and ordered their general affairs; but their
laws must be sent to every town, to be deliberately considered
in their town meetings, from whence the clerk was to
send an account of their votes to the General Recorder;
and, if the majority of the towns approved the law, it was
confirmed, if not, it was disannulled. The Assembly
chose yearly a Treasurer and a General Recorder and General
Sergeant, which are only other names for a Secretary
and Sheriff. In each town, six persons were yearly chosen,
who were called the Town Council, who had the powers
of a Court of Probate, of granting licenses to inn-keepers
and retailers, and the care of the poor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The first General Assembly met at Portsmouth, May 19,
1647, when John Coggshall was chosen President, Roger
Williams assistant for Providence, John Sanford for Portsmouth,
William Coddington for Newport, and Randall
Holden for Warwick. William Dyer was chosen Recorder.
They agreed upon a body of laws, chiefly taken from
the laws of England, with the addition of a few suited to
their particular circumstances. In the introduction of this
code, the form of government established is called “democratical,
that is to say, a government held by the free and
voluntary consent of all, or the greater part of the free inhabitants.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The code, which contains nothing except civil regulations,
concludes thus: “Otherwise than thus, what is herein
forbidden, all men may walk as their consciences persuade
them, every one in the name of his God. And let
the lambs of the Most High walk, in this colony, without
molestation, in the name of Jehovah, their God, forever
and ever.” This noble principle was thus established, as
one of the fundamental laws, at the first Assembly under
the charter. It is indigenous to the Rhode-Island soil, and
is the glory of the state.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams had a large share in thus organizing the
government. His services were gratefully recognized by
the Assembly, who, at their first session, adopted the following
resolution:<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c010'><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“That forasmuch as Mr. Roger Williams hath taken
great pains, and expended much time, in obtaining the
charter for this province, of our noble Lords and Governors,
be it enacted and established, that, in regard to his so great
trouble, charges and good endeavors, we do freely give and
grant unto the said Mr. Roger Williams an hundred pounds,
to be levied out of the three towns, viz.: fifty pounds out of
Newport, thirty pounds of Portsmouth, twenty pounds out
of Providence; which rate is to be levied and paid in by
the last of November.” Backus, vol. i. p. 199.</p>

<p class='c009'>This grant of one hundred pounds was voted, but for
some reason, Mr. Williams never received it all.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c010'><sup>[259]</sup></a> It was,
undoubtedly, a very inadequate compensation for his toils
and expenses, in procuring the charter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following very characteristic letter belongs here.

<p class='c009'>The following agreement, written, evidently, by Mr.
Williams, and signed by himself and several of the citizens
of Providence, is a proof of his pacific principles, and of
his desire for the peace and welfare of the colony:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Considering the great mercy afforded unto us, in this
liberty thus to meet together, being denied to many of our
countrymen in most parts, especially in our poor native
country, now deploring their distressed condition in most
sad and bloody calamities: That ingratitude and disacknowledgments
for favors received, are just causes for the
deprivation of them, together with home divisions and home
conspiracies, the ruination of families, towns and countries.
Moreover, the many plots and present endeavors,
at home and abroad, not only to disturb our peace and liberties,
but utterly to root up both root and branch of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>our being; that government held forth through love, union
and order, although by few in number and mean in condition,
yet (by experience) hath withstood and overcome
mighty opposers; and, above all, the several unexpected
deliverances of this poor plantation, by that mighty Providence
who is still able to deliver us, through love, union
and order. Therefore, being sensible of these great and
weighty premises, and now met together to consult about
our peace and liberty, whereby our families and posterity
may still enjoy these favors; and that we may publicly declare
unto all the free discharge of all our consciences and
duties, whereby it may appear upon record that we are not
wilfully opposite, nor careless and senseless, and thereby
the means of our own and others’ ruin and destruction;—and
especially in testimony of our fidelity and cordial affection
unto one another here present, that so there may be a
current placable proceeding, we do faithfully and unanimously,
by this our subscription, promise unto each other to keep
unto these ensuing particulars: First, that the foundation
in love may appear among us, what causes of difference
have heretofore been given, either by word or misbehavior,
in public or private, concerning particular or general affairs,
by any of us here present, not to mention or repeat
them in the assembly, but that love shall cover the multitude
of them in the grave of oblivion. Secondly, that union
may proceed from love, we do promise to keep constant
unto those several engagements made by us, both unto our
town and colony, and that, to the uttermost of our powers
and abilities to maintain our lawful rights and privileges,
and to uphold the government of this plantation. Also,
that love may appear in union, we desire to abandon all
causeless fears and jealousies of one another, only aiming
at the general and particular peace and union of this town
and colony. Lastly, for our more orderly proceeding in
this assembly, whereby love and union may appear in order,
if in our consultations differences in judgment shall arise,
then moderately in order, through argumentation, to agitate
the same; considering the cause, how far it may be hurtful,
or conducing unto our union, peace and liberty, and
accordingly act, not after the will or person of any, but
unto the justice and righteousness of the cause. Again,
if such cause shall be presented, wherein such difficulties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>shall appear, that evident arguments cannot be given for
present satisfaction, but that either town or colony, or both,
shall suffer, then to take into consideration a speech of a
beloved friend, “better to suffer an inconvenience than a
mischief,” better to suspend with a loss that may be inconvenient,
than to be totally disunited and bereaved of all
rights and liberties, which will be a mischief indeed.
Moreover, that offences and distractions may be prevented,
that so the current of business may peaceably proceed in
this assembly, we do faithfully promise to carry ourselves,
in words and behavior, so moderately and orderly as the
cause shall permit; and if any of us shall fly out in provoking,
scurrilous, exorbitant speeches, and unsuitable
behavior, that he or they so doing shall be publicly declared,
branded, and noted upon record, to be a covenant violator,
and disturber of the union, peace and liberty of this
plantation. We do here subscribe, without partiality.

</div>

<p class='c009'>It is a proof, that Mr. Williams was not a very ambitious
man, that he put himself entirely on a level with his fellow
citizens, and was willing to serve the colony in the subordinate
situation of an assistant. He was entitled, from his
character and services, to be the first President; but he
was, doubtless, disposed to yield his own claims, to conciliate
the other towns. His services, as a peace-maker, were
often needed.</p>

<p class='c009'>It could scarcely be expected, that towns, composed of
so many discordant materials, would coalesce quietly in one
government. The principle on which the colony was founded,
made it the resort of many uneasy spirits, who occasioned
difficulties which disturbed its peace, and brought undeserved
odium on the better portion of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c009'>In May, 1648, Mr. Coddington was elected President,
and Jeremiah Clarke, Roger Williams, William Baulstone,
and John Smith, Assistants; Philip Sherman, Recorder;
and Alexander Partridge, General Sergeant.</p>

<p class='c009'>In September following, Mr. Coddington and Mr. Partridge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>applied, in person, to the commissioners of the united
colonies, requesting that the island of Rhode-Island might
be received as a member of the league, alleging it to be the
desire of a majority of the inhabitants. But the commissioners
refused to admit them, unless the island were placed
under the jurisdiction of Plymouth. It was a happy event
for Rhode-Island, that this request was refused, for had it
been granted, the effect might have been the separation of
the island from the rest of the colony.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this posture of affairs, Mr. Williams again tried his influence
as a peace-maker. In August, 1648, he addressed
the following letter to the town of Providence:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Worthy friends, that ourselves and all men are apt and
prone to differ, it is no new thing. In all former ages, in
all parts of the world, in these parts, and in our dear native
country and mournful state of England, that either part or
party is most right in his own eyes, his cause right, his
carriage right, his arguments right, his answers right, is as
wofully and constantly true as the former. And experience
tells us, that when the God of peace hath taken peace from
the earth, one spark of action, word or carriage is too powerful
to kindle such a fire as burns up towns, cities, armies,
navies, nations and kingdoms. And since, dear friends, it
is an honor for men to cease from strife; since the life of
love is sweet, and union is as strong as sweet; and since
you have been lately pleased to call me to some public service
and my soul hath been long musing how I might bring
water to quench, and not oil or fuel to the flame, I am now
humbly bold to beseech you, by all those comforts of earth
and heaven which a placable and peaceable spirit will bring
to you, and by all those dreadful alarms and warnings, either
amongst ourselves, in deaths and sicknesses, or abroad in
the raging calamities of the sword, death and pestilence; I
say humbly and earnestly beseech you to be willing to be
pacifiable, willing to be reconcilable, willing to be sociable,
and to listen to the (I hope not unreasonable) motion following:
To try out matters by disputes and writings, is
sometimes endless; to try out arguments by arms and
swords, is cruel and merciless; to trouble the state and
Lords of England, is most unreasonable, most chargeable;
to trouble our neighbors of other colonies, seems neither
safe nor honorable. Methinks, dear friends, the colony now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>looks with the torn face of two parties, and that the greater
number of Portsmouth, with other loving friends adhering
to them, appear as one grieved party; the other three towns,
or greater part of them, appear to be another: Let each
party choose and nominate three; Portsmouth and friends
adhering three, the other party three, one out of each town;
let authority be given to them to examine every public difference,
grievance and obstruction of justice, peace and
common safety: let them, by one final sentence of all or

unanimous posture and order, and let them set a censure
upon any that shall oppose their sentence. One log, without
your gentle help, I cannot stir; it is this: How shall
the minds of the towns be known? How shall the persons
chosen be called? Time and place appointed in any expedition?
For myself I can thankfully embrace the help of
Mr. Coddington or Mr. Clarke, joined or apart, but how
many are there who will attend, (as our distempers are) to
neither? It is, gentlemen, in the power of the body to require
the help of any of her members, and both King and
Parliament plead, that in extraordinary cases they have
been forced to extraordinary ways for common safety. Let
me be friendly construed, if (for expedition) I am bold to
be too forward in this service, and to say, that if within
twenty days of the date hereof, you please to send to my
house, at Providence, the name of him whom you please to
nominate, at your desire I will acquaint all the persons

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, our neighbors Mr. Coddington and Capt. Partridge,
ten days since, returned from Plymouth with propositions
for Rhode-Island to subject to Plymouth; to which himself
and Portsmouth incline; our other three towns decline, and
Mr. Holden and Mr. Warner, of Warwick, came from
thence also, and they say, gave satisfaction why they dare
not (the other three towns) depart from the charter. Sir,
in this division of our neighbors, I have kept myself unengaged,
and presented motions of pacification, amongst
which I was bold to propose a reference to your worthy
self and some other friend to be chosen; our town yields
to it, and Mr. Boston (though opposite) and possibly you
may have the trouble and honor of a peace-maker.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, pray seal the enclosed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It appears by this letter, and by other evidence, that
Plymouth was desirous to add the beautiful island to her
territory. Three years before, she claimed it as belonging
to her jurisdiction; and Massachusetts insisted on her title
to the allegiance of the inhabitants of Pawtuxet and Warwick.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c010'><sup>[261]</sup></a>
Winthrop says, under the date of May, 1645:<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c010'><sup>[262]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“The government of Plymouth sent one of their magistrates,
Mr. Brown, to Aquetneck island, to forbid Mr. Williams,
&amp;c. to exercise any of their pretended authority
upon the island, claiming it to be within their jurisdiction.
Our Court also sent to forbid them to exercise any authority
within that part of our jurisdiction at Pawtuxet and Shawomet,
and although they had boasted to do great matters
there, by virtue of their charter, yet they dared not to
attempt any thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Connecticut afterwards laid claim to a part of the western
territory of Rhode-Island. Thus was the little colony
pressed on each side by her more powerful neighbors, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>would gladly have enacted, at that early day, the same
scene which was long afterwards presented in Poland,
though the wrong would certainly have been less flagrant,
and the motive less criminal. Thanks to the protection of
God, and to the prudent firmness of Mr. Williams and others,
the colony escaped all the designs of her neighbors, and
has continued till this day, small in territory, but strong in
her love of freedom, and consistent in her maintenance of
the principles of her founder.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Indians again disturbed the colonies. “In August,
1648,” says Mr. Backus,<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c010'><sup>[263]</sup></a> “about one thousand Indians
from various parts were collected in Connecticut, with three
hundred guns among them, and it was reported that they
were hired by the Narragansets to fight with Uncas. The
magistrates of Hartford sent three horsemen to inquire what
they designed, and to let them know, that if they made war
with him, the English must defend him, upon which they
dispersed. When the commissioners met at Plymouth the
next month, they ordered four men to be sent to the Narragansets,
with instructions how to treat with them, both concerning
their hiring other Indians to war upon Uncas, and
also about the tribute of wampum that was behind. Captain
Atherton and Captain Prichard undertook the service,
and going to Mr. Williams, they procured the sachems to
be sent for, but they, hearing that many horsemen were
come to take them, shifted for themselves. Passacus fled
to Rhode-Island, but soon after, they were, by Mr. Williams’
means, delivered of their fears, and came to the messengers
as they were desired, and denied their hiring the
Mohawks to war against Uncas, though they owned that
they had sent them a present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The following letters to Mr. Winthrop, relating to the
concerns of the Indians, with occasional references to the
important events which were then transpiring in England,
may be properly introduced here:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Best salutations to your dear selves and loving sister.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>In my last I intimated a promise of presenting you
with what here passeth. Captain Atherton, Captain Prichard,
Richard Wood and Strong Tuchell, have been with
me (as also Wm. Arnold, instead of his son Benedict, who
withdrew himself, though sent unto,) these six or seven days.
They were at Niantick two nights. Captain Atherton purposed
to visit you, but they appointing their meeting with
all the sachems at my house, they came back; and this
morning, (the fourth day of the week,) they are departed
with good content toward the Bay. From the commissioners
they brought several articles, but the main were
three; concerning the Mohawks, &amp;c.; 2d, the payment;
3d, Uncas’ future safety. To the first, they sent answer
(and that they confirmed with many asseverations, and
one of them voluntarily took the Englishmen’s God to witness)
that they gave not a penny to hire the Mohawks
against the Mohegans, but that it was wholly wrought by
Wussoonkquassin, (which they discovered as a secret) who
being bound by Uncas, and Wuttouwuttauoum, Uncas his
cousin, having attempted to shoot a Mohawk sachem at
that time, resolved with the Mohawks (to whom he also
gave peag) to take revenge upon Uncas; Wussoonkquassin
sent them word and desired peag of them in the spring, but
they profess they consented not, nor sent not a penny, afterwards
they sent Waupinhommin up to inquire to Pawcatuck
and however they have given some of the Mohegans
peag this year, (as they have always done) yet they
say they are clear from giving a penny in hire, &amp;c. They
confess their enmity against Uncas, and they (to the 2d)
will not rest until they have finished their payments, that
they may present their complaints against Uncas, who (they
say) and other Indians, within these three years, have committed
thirteen murders with impunity, being out of their
reach in the English protection. This last year they pleaded
they were near starved, and, therefore, sent but a small
quantity. Now they promise, upon return of their men
from hunting this winter, to make a contribution, the next
spring another, and so according as they can draw the people
to it, will not cease to furnish, and if they die, their
children shall fulfil, and that it is their sore grief, &amp;c. with
much to this purpose. For Uncas they profess neither directly
nor indirectly, to have to do with him, yet hope the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>English will not deal partially with him. They desired the
English receipt of their peag; I produced the note you sent
me, which, because it was not signed with your father’s hand
or the Treasurer’s, &amp;c. the messengers promised to send
them one from the Bay. Ninigret, made great lamentation
that you had entertained hard thoughts of him in this business,
and all the sachems here professed their sorrow and that
you had hearkened to Wequashcook, who they say never
contributed nor joined in the Pequod wars, and now flatters
to draw his neck out of the payments to the English.
They hope you will not countenance him to rob Ninigret
of those hunting places which the commissioners gave him
leave to make use of, and he with the English had fought
for with the expense of much treasure and hazard of his
life. They desire that he may and Causasenamon and the
rest of the Pequods, be as your little dogs, but not as your
confederates, which they say is unworthy yourself, &amp;c.
Sir, I perceive the English about the Bay inquire after new
places. Captain Atherton prays me shortly to convey a
letter to you. I forgot one passage that the sachems discovered,
that Wussoonkquassin gave peag to the Mohawks
to retreat. It seems they are (Switzer like) mercenary, and
were hired on and off; these sachems I believe desire cordially
to hold friendship with both the English and the Mohawks
together; I am confident (whether they lie or not,
about Wussoonkquassin) that they never intended hurt
against the English nor yourself and yours especially, to
whom they profess great respect, and jointly they desire that
Wequashcook may come back to Connecticut from whence
he went, for if he join with Uncas they suspect he will
secretly be a means of some of their deaths. Lastly, whereas
they heard that the women with you were something fearful,
Ninigret prays Mrs. Winthrop to be assured, that there
never was, nor never shall be, to his knowledge, the least
offence given to her or her neighbors, by any of his (though
he hath learnt it partly by your just abhorring of Uncas his
outrageous carriage among you, and of which I have not
softly told these messengers and the admired partiality in
the case.) For a token of his fidelity to Mrs. Winthrop,
Ninigret he prays me to write, that all the women of his
town shall present Mrs. Winthrop with a present of corn at
Pawcatuck, if she please to send in any conveyance to Pawcatuck
for it.</p>

Block-Island, whether it might be had of the natives,

Sir, because God hath pitched your tent these ways, and
you know much among the natives of these parts, I judged
it not unfit to pray you help me with a word of your information,
before I write what otherwise I can, from the
barbarians. The counsels of the Most High are deep concerning
us poor grasshoppers, hopping and skipping from
branch to twig in this vale of tears. Wm. Peacock hath had
a very heavy task in carrying Joseph with cattle from you;
six or seven days and nights the poor fellow was seeking
them (being lost and scattered from Niantick.) Then he
brought six to my house, four being finally lost; I took
what pains I could to get them sought again, and three I
hear are found, after which Wm. Peacock is now out, and
I look for him this night with those three; Ninigret did his
part honestly, but the youths and boys thereabouts (by some
occasion hallooing) the cattle thence took the woods. Joseph
Wild hath written to me, and I acquaint him with the
cause, that one man alone cannot well drive cattle amongst
barbarians, especially without an Indian guide. It were
exceeding well that three or four poles were enclosed at
Niantick, to keep cattle there at night, for if God vouchsafe
peace and plantations (prosperity) there is great needs of it.</p>

Block-Island, and on a neck at Niantick; the other, to
yourself, in which protesting his innocence as to the death
of his son-in-law, with which Uncas and the Pequods charge

you can) items to the Pequods, that they be quiet and attempt
nothing (at least, treacherously,) against him, which
he suspects, from words from Uncas, that it will be pleasing
to the English. He prays you also to be mindful of endeavoring
to remove Wequashcook, so constant a provocation
before him; and, at present, he prays you to send for
some skins, which lately, as lord of the place, he hath received.
I hope the English sachems, as I tell him, in the

expected your passage, and being at Providence, hastened
purposely to attend you here. Our candle burns out day and
night, we need not hasten its end (by swaling) in unnecessary
miseries, unless God call us for him to suffer, whose
our breath is, and hath promised to such as hate life for
him, an eternal. Sir, this last week, I read an ordinance
of both houses, (dated third month, May last) decreeing
death to some consciences, but imprisonment to far more,
ever (upon the point) to all but Presbyterians. We have
a sound, that Fairfax and Cromwell are proclaimed traitors,
but I rather credit that report, that Cromwell only was sent
for by the Parliament, which, it seems, inclines with the
king, and the city all against the army. The Earl of Warwick
was gone for Holland with twenty-two ships pursuing
the Prince. Mr. Foot and others went to Holland, (whither
Mr. Trevice his ship was carried) and were offered the ship for
two thousand pounds, but I cannot hear of their agreement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>About forty from the Parliament went to the King, to the
Isle of Wight, (who was lately and strangely prevented of
escape) to treat, but could not agree upon the first, viz.
that the King should acknowledge the beginning of the war
to be his. Sir, this is the chief of matters told me few
days since, by Mr. Throgmorton, who came ten days since
from the Bay, and came well in a full laden vessel to anchor
by Saconet rocks, but it pleased God his new cable was
cut by the rocks, and he drove upon Rhode-Island shore,
where it is feared the vessel is spoiled, but (through God’s
mercy) he saved his goods. Sir, Mr. Brewster, (by letter)
requests me to convey three letters and bags of metal to
you. I wish they may have worth in them, especially to
draw us up to dig into the heavens for true treasure. Sir,
(though Mr. Brewster wrote me not word of it) yet in
private, I am bold to tell you, that I hear it hath pleased
God greatly to afflict him in the thorns of this life. He was
intended for Virginia; his creditors in the Bay came to
Portsmouth and unhung his rudder, carried him to the Bay,
where he was forced to make over all, house, land, cattle,
and part with all to his chest. Oh how sweet is a dry
morsel and a handful, with quietness from earth and
heaven. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sane nescio de quo scribis furti suspecto.</span> John

fierce controversy then maintained between the King and
Parliament, in England, had some share in the difficulties
between Mr. Coddington and his friends. Mr. Coddington
was attached to the King, and was disposed to uphold his
interest in the colony.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following letter to Mr. Winthrop, which is without

desires, that, since it pleaseth God to hinder your presence
this way, he may please, for his infinite mercy’s sake, in his
Son’s blood, to further our eternal meeting in the presence
of him that sits upon the throne, and the Lamb forever;
and that the hope thereof may be living, and bring forth
the fruits of love where it is possible, and of lamenting for
obstructions. Sir, the affairs of our country (Vaderland,
as the Dutch speak) would have afforded us much conference.
The merciful Lord help us to make up in prayer to
his holy majesty, &amp;c. Sir, for this land, our poor colony
is in civil dissension. Their last meetings, at which I have
not been, have fallen into factions; Mr. Coddington and
Captain Partridge, &amp;c. are the heads of the one, and Captain
Clarke, Mr. Easton, &amp;c. the heads of the other faction.
I receive letters from both, inviting me, &amp;c. but I
resolve (if the Lord please) not to engage, unless with great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>hopes of peace-making. The peace makers are sons of
God. Our neighbors, the Narragansets, are now consulting,
and making peag, to carry, within a few weeks, another
payment. Sir, about a month since, one William
Badger, a seaman, and now a planter at William Field’s
farm, near Providence, passed by me, travelling to the Seabrook.
I have received letters since from Captain Mason,
to whom I wrote by him, and hear nothing of him. I fear
he miscarried, for he was alone, without a guide. And,
since I mention Captain Mason, worthy Sir, I humbly beg
of the Father of Lights to guide you, in your converse and
neighborhood with him. In his letters to me, he tells me
of some extraordinary lifts against Uncas, and that he will
favor him, but no more than religion and reason bid him.
He promiseth to visit me, in his passage, this summer, eastward,
(I guess he means toward Plymouth.) I shall then
argue, if God will, many things, and how it stands with
religion and reason, that such a monstrous hurry and affrightment
should be offered to an English town, either by
Indians or English, unpunished. Sir, you have seen many
parts of this world’s snowball, and never found aught but
vanity and vexation. At Nameug shall you find no
more, except in the fountain of living waters. Sir, heap
coals of fire on Captain Mason’s head; conquer evil with
good, but be not cowardly, and overcome with any evil.</p>

the island from the colony, and unite it to Plymouth, resolved

occasioned. This letter was written on the envelope, or

<p class='c009'>In May, 1649, the General Court met at Warwick, when
Mr. John Smith was chosen President, Mr. Williams having,
as it appears declined a re-election. Among the
assistants chosen, was Mr. Gorton. Mr. Williams was
chosen “to take a view of the records delivered into the
Court by Mr. William Dyre,” referring, probably, to his
complaints against Mr. Coddington. These complaints
were again presented to the Court, but were deferred, in
consequence, we may suppose, of the absence of Mr. Coddington.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this Court, a law was made, that if a President should
be elected, and should refuse to serve, he should be fined
ten pounds, and an assistant, in like circumstances, five
pounds. We may infer, from this law, that the men of
those times were either too humble to covet the honors, or
too poor to sustain the expenses, of office. The want of
ambition may, perhaps, be fairly considered, as the chief
cause. It would be happy for our country, if a portion of
this temper of our ancestors, were inherited by their descendants.
The furious struggle for power is one of the
most ominous evils in our free republic.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>The following letter from Mr. Williams was written a
few days after the session of the Court. It is interesting,
for several reasons. The excellent regulation, forbidding
the sale or gift of spirituous liquors to the natives, except
at the discretion of Mr. Williams, shows, at once, the
wise and humane policy of the colony towards the natives,
and the confidence which they placed in him.</p>

<p class='c009'>This letter is remarkable, too, for the notice which it
contains of the execution of Charles I., who, on the 30th
of January preceding, was beheaded at Whitehall, in pursuance
of the sentence of his judges. That Charles had
forfeited his crown, will scarcely be denied by any man at
the present day, unless he be an advocate for arbitrary rule.
That the unhappy King did not deserve to die, will now,
perhaps, with almost equal unanimity, be maintained, except
by those whose political principles bias their judgment,
and silence the emotions of their hearts. Of the
inexpediency of the execution, the effects are the best
proof. The reaction, which was produced in the feelings
of the nation, was, doubtless, one of the causes of the restoration,
and of the consequent evils. The letter was endorsed
by Mr. Winthrop, “Mr. Williams, of the high news
about the King.”</p>

Capt. Mason, (and, as he said, from Uncas and Wequashcook.)

loving letters (and tokens, which, upon the burning of his

these natives, especially to the sachems, and most of all,
to Ninigret. The purport of the letters and concurrence
of circumstances, seem to me to imply some present conclusions
(from Connecticut) of hostility, and I question
whether or no present and speedy, before the meeting of
commissioners, which I saw lately from the Court, under
Mr. Nowell’s hand, was not to be till the 7th month. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>murdering of Uncas is alleged by stabbing, and since attempted
by witches, &amp;c. The conclusion is therefore
ruin. The words of the letter are: ‘If nothing but
blood will satisfy them, I doubt not but they may have
their fill; and again, I perceive such an obstinate wilfulness,
joined with desperate malicious practices, that I
think and believe <em>they are sealed to destruction</em>.’ Sir,
there are many devices in a man’s heart, but the counsel

</div>

<p class='c014'>Warwick—Mr. Williams’ compensation—imprisonment of John
Clarke and Obadiah Holmes—Mr. Coddington’s separate charter—Mr.
Williams and Mr. Clarke prepare to go to England.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been seen, that although Warwick was not named
in the charter, yet that settlement, having obtained from
England the sanction of the commissioners, had joined with
the other towns, in forming a civil government. But a
portion of the inhabitants of Pawtuxet, having submitted
themselves to the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, refused to
acknowledge the authority of the charter. At the General
Assembly, at Warwick, in May, 1649, it was “ordered,
that a messenger be sent to Pomham and the other sachem,
to require them to come to this Court; and that letters
be sent to Benedict Arnold and his father, and the rest
of Pawtuxet, about their subjecting to this colony.” They
persisted in their refusal; and, although the territory was
undeniably included in the charter obtained by Mr. Williams,
yet these inhabitants of Pawtuxet and its vicinity
continued for several years to resist the authority of the
General Assembly of Rhode-Island, and caused much annoyance
to the colony. In this conduct, they were upheld
by the government of Massachusetts. In 1650, as we are
informed by Mr. Backus,<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c010'><sup>[268]</sup></a> “William Arnold and William
Carpenter, instead of submitting to the government of their
own colony, went again and entered complaints against
some of their neighbors to the Massachusetts rulers, and
they sent a citation to some of them to come and answer
the same in their courts, dated from Boston, June 20, 1650,
signed by Edward Rawson, Secretary.”<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c010'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>There seems to have been much disinclination to pay
the sum voted to Mr. Williams for his services in procuring
the charter. At the General Assembly, in May, 1650,
three years after the grant, it was found necessary to send
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>a fresh order to the towns to collect and pay the sums due,
within twenty days. This order was not entirely successful,
and it is nearly certain, that the whole amount was
never paid. It is probable, that few disputed the justice of
the grant, and we may hope, that the unhappy jealousies
which subsisted between individuals, and some of the towns,
together with the poverty of the inhabitants, rather than a
deliberate disregard of Mr. Williams’ just claims, were the
causes of the failure. But gratitude has not been the most
conspicuous virtue, either of kings or of republics. The
patriotic Winthrop spent his large estate, and his life, in
the service of Massachusetts; yet was he compelled to submit
to an impeachment, from which, however, he issued
with a purer fame. It is a lamentable fact, that men are
often imboldened to do, in concert, what they would not
venture to do, in their individual capacity. They seem to
think, that they lose their identity in a crowd, and that guilt,
in which many share, becomes so divided and attenuated, as
to leave a very insignificant portion to each person. Human
passions, too, are contagious, and a large assembly
sometimes inflame each other to the perpetration of deeds,
of which each man would, when alone, have been ashamed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The memorable transactions in Massachusetts, in which
the Rev. John Clarke, Mr. Obadiah Holmes and Mr.
John Crandall<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c010'><sup>[270]</sup></a> had so melancholy a share, deserve a notice.
They show the rigor, with which the famous law of 1644,
levelled ostensibly against anabaptists, was executed; and
the special aversion which was felt towards intruders from
Rhode-Island.</p>

<p class='c009'>In July, 1651, these gentlemen were deputed by the
Baptist church in Newport, to visit William Witter, an aged
member of that church, who resided at Lynn, a few miles
east of Boston. Mr. Witter was an old man, and being
unable to visit the church, he had requested an interview
with some of his brethren. On this most Christian and inoffensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>errand, the committee proceeded to Lynn. Their
aged brother resided about two miles from the town, and the
next day being the Sabbath, it was thought proper to spend
it in religious worship at his house. Mr. Clarke preached
from Rev. 3: 10. “Because thou hast kept the word of
my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation,
which shall come upon all the world, to try them that
dwell upon the earth.” In the midst of his sermon, he was
interrupted by two constables. Mr. Clarke thus describes
the scene:</p>

<p class='c016'>“While in conscience towards God, and good will unto
his saints, I was imparting to my companions in the house
where I lodged, and to four or five strangers that came in
unexpected after I had begun, opening and proving what
is meant by the hour of temptation, what by the word of
his patience, and their keeping it, and how he that hath
the key of David (being the promiser) will keep those who
keep the word of his patience, from the hour of temptation.
While, I say, I was yet speaking, there came into the house
where we were, two constables, who, with their clamorous
tongues, made an interruption in my discourse, and more
uncivilly disturbed us than the pursuivants of the old English
bishops were wont to do, telling us that they were come
with authority from the magistrate to apprehend us. I then
desired to see the authority by which they thus proceeded,
whereupon they plucked forth their warrant, and one of
them, with a trembling hand, (as conscious he might have
been better employed) read it to us; the substance whereof
was as followeth:</p>

<p class='c016'>‘By virtue hereof, you are required to go to the house
of William Witter, and so to search from house to house,
for certain erroneous persons, being strangers, and them to
apprehend, and in safe custody to keep, and to-morrow
morning, at eight o’clock, to bring before me.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘ROBERT BRIDGES.’”<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c010'><sup>[271]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The constables carried Mr. Clarke and his companions
to the Congregational meeting, where they were compelled
to stay till the service was closed. Mr. Clarke then rose
and addressed the assembly, but was speedily silenced, and
the next day, the three heretics were committed to prison in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Boston. A few days afterwards, they were tried, before
the Court of Assistants, and Mr. Clarke was sentenced to
pay a fine of twenty pounds, Mr. Holmes thirty pounds, and
Mr. Crandall five pounds; or, in default of payment, each
was to be whipped. They refused to pay the fine, for the
plain reason, that the payment of a fine is an acknowledgment
of guilt, of which they felt themselves to be innocent.
They were accordingly committed to prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the trial, Mr. Clarke defended himself and his companions
so ably, that the Court were somewhat embarrassed.
“At length, (says Mr. Clarke) the Governor stepped up and
told us we had denied infant baptism, and being somewhat
transported, told me I had deserved death, and said he
would not have such trash brought into their jurisdiction.
Moreover he said, ‘you go up and down, and secretly insinuate
into those that are weak, but you cannot maintain
it before our ministers. You may try and dispute with
them.’ To this I had much to reply, but he commanded
the jailer to take us away.”<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c010'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>From the prison, Mr. Clarke sent to the Court a proposition
to meet with any of the ministers, and hold a public
discussion. This proposal was at first accepted, and a day
was fixed. But the clergy probably thought, that a public
debate about infant baptism, with so able an antagonist,
would be inexpedient. Mr. Clarke’s fine was accordingly
paid, without his knowledge or consent, and he was released
from prison. He was anxious for an opportunity to maintain,
publicly, his opinions, and to vindicate his innocence.
But he could not succeed in bringing his opponents to the
trial of argument. Leaving, therefore, with the magistrates
a declaration, that he would be ready, at any time, to visit
Boston, and maintain his sentiments, he, together with Mr.
Crandall, who was released on condition of appearing at
the next Court, returned to Newport.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two following letters from Mr. Williams to Mr. Winthrop,
were written about this time, probably in August,
1651:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sir,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Loving respects to you both, with Mrs. Lake and yours.
By this opportunity I am bold to inform you, that from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Bay I hear of the sentence on Mr. Clarke, to be whipt or
pay twenty pounds, Obadiah Holmes whipt or thirty pounds,
on John Crandall, whipt or five pounds. This bearer hears
of no payment nor execution, but rather a demur, and some
kind of conference. The Father of Lights graciously guide
them and us in such paths; for other succor than that (in
his mouth) Christ Jesus walks not among the churches,
(Rev. 1.) Sir, upon those provocations that lately (as in
my last I hinted) Auguontis gave the sachems, Ninigret,
Pitammock and Pesiccosh, went in person to their town,
(Chaubutick) and upon Pummakommins telling the sachems
that he was as great a sachem as they, they all fell together
by the ears; yet no blood spilt. The Chaubatick Indians
send to the Bay; they say Auguontis is sent for and Ninigret,
but I know no certain other than messengers passing
to and again from Chaubatick to the Bay. Here was last
week Mr. Sellick, of Boston, and Mr. Gardiner, a young
merchant, to fetch my corn, and more, from Mr. Paine, of
Seekonk; they are bound to the French, unless diverted.
They tell me of a ship of 300, come from Barbadoes. Mr.
Wall, the master, stood upon his guard while he staid
there; he brought some passengers, former inhabitants from
London, whose case was sad there, because of the posture
of the island (where, as I have by letter from a godly friend
there) they force all to swear to religion and laws. This
Mr. Wall hath a new and great design, viz. from hence to
the East Indies. The frigates designed for Barbadoes were
ordered for Scilly, which they assaulted, and took forts and
ordnance and frigates, and drove the Governor into his last
fort. It hath pleased God to bring your ancient acquaintance
and mine, Mr. Coddington, in Mr. Carwithy his ship
of 500; he is made Governor of this colony for his life.
General Cromwell was not wounded nor defeated, (as is
said) but sick of flux and fever, and mending, and had a
victory over the Scots. Sir, this world passeth away and
the (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σχημα</span>) fashion, shape and form of it, only the word
of Jehovah remains. That word literal is sweet, as it is the
field where the mystical word or treasure, Christ Jesus, lies
hid.</p>

the disputation, but they could not hit, and although (my
much lamented friend) the Governor told him, that he was

<p class='c009'>Mr. Holmes was confined in prison till September, when
thirty stripes were inflicted on him, with such merciless
severity, that he could not, for a considerable time, take
any rest, except by supporting himself with his knees and
elbows. Two individuals (John Spur and John Hazel,<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c010'><sup>[274]</sup></a>)
were imprisoned and fined for the grievous offence of exhibiting
some sympathy for the sufferer. Mr. Holmes was
released, but he continued in Massachusetts, and baptized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>several individuals. Warrants were again issued to apprehend
him, and he returned home to his family.</p>

<p class='c009'>The recital of these transactions is painful, but we must
compel ourselves to contemplate such scenes, if we would
suitably feel the contrast between the policy of Massachusetts,
at that day, and the tolerant principles of Roger
Williams. To that policy must it be ascribed, that wise
and good men could thus treat their fellow Christians. It
is pleasing to know, however, that this conduct was not
unanimously approved, by those who were free from all
suspicion of anabaptism. Sir Richard Saltonstall, one of
the magistrates of Massachusetts, then in England, wrote
thus to Messrs. Cotton and Wilson:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Reverend and dear friends, whom I unfeignedly love
and respect:</p>

<p class='c016'>“It doth not a little grieve my spirit, to hear what sad
things are reported daily of your tyranny and persecutions
in New-England, as that you fine, whip and imprison men
for their consciences. First, you compel such to come into
your assemblies as you know will not join you in your worship,
and when they show their dislike thereof, or witness
against it, then you stir up your magistrates to punish them
for such (as you conceive) their public affronts. Truly,
friends, this your practice of compelling any in matters of
worship, to do that whereof they are not fully persuaded,
is to make them sin, for so the apostle (Rom. 14: 23) tells
us, and many are made hypocrites thereby, conforming in
their outward man, for fear of punishment. We pray for
you, and wish you prosperity every way, hoping the Lord
would have given you so much light and love there, that
you might have been eyes to God’s people here, and not to
practise those courses in a wilderness, which you went so
far to prevent. These rigid ways have laid you very low
in the hearts of the saints.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Cotton replied to this letter. After stating that
Mr. Clarke and Mr. Holmes had offended against the “order
and government of our churches, established, <em>we know</em>, by
God’s law,” he furnishes this remarkable specimen of
sophistry: “You think, to compel men in matters of worship
is to make them sin. If the worship be lawful in itself,
the magistrate compelling him to come to it compelleth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>him not to sin, but the sin is in his will that needs to be
compelled to a Christian duty. If it do make men hypocrites,
yet better be hypocrites than profane persons.
Hypocrites give God part of his dues, the outward man;
but the profane person giveth God neither outward nor inward
man. You know not, if you think we came into this
wilderness, to practise those courses here, which we fled
from in England. We believe there is a vast difference
between men’s inventions and God’s institutions. We fled
from men’s inventions, to which we else should have been
compelled. We compel none to men’s inventions. If our
ways (rigid ways, as you call them,) have laid us low in
the hearts of God’s people, yea, and of the saints, (as you
style them) we do not believe it is any part of their saintship.
Nevertheless, I tell you the truth, we have tolerated
in our churches some anabaptists, some antinomians, and
some seekers, and do so still, at this day. We are far
from arrogating infallibility of judgment to ourselves, or
affecting uniformity. Uniformity God never required; infallibility
he never granted us.”<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c010'><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>There is, in this reply, somewhat more of asperity than
Mr. Cotton’s writings usually exhibit. It is easy to perceive,
that the good man’s spirit was chafed by the rebuke
from one of his own friends. Nothing tries a man’s temper
more than reproof, when he is secretly convinced
that he has done wrong, and is yet unprepared to acknowledge
it. It is a sore task to defend himself, when his conscience
is on the side of the accuser. In such a case, a
man is apt to resort to confident and emphatic assertions,
rather than to calm arguments.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have mentioned Mr. Coddington’s visit to England,
for the purpose of procuring a charter for the islands of
Rhode-Island, Canonicut, &amp;c. He procured from the
Council of State, which then wielded the executive power
in England,<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c010'><sup>[276]</sup></a> a commission, dated April 3, 1651, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>signed by John Bradshaw, constituting Mr. Coddington
governor of the islands, and empowering him to rule them,
with a council of six men, nominated by the people, and
approved by himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Coddington returned about the first of August, 1651.
His new charter at once subverted the existing government,
by severing the islands from the other towns. Much
agitation of feeling naturally ensued. Those inhabitants
of the islands, who were opposed to Mr. Coddington’s
measures, were alarmed at finding themselves thus subjected
to his power. The towns of Warwick and Providence
were annoyed by the inhabitants of Pawtuxet, consisting
of whites and Indians, who rejected the government
of Rhode-Island, and adhered to that of Massachusetts.
The Indians committed many depredations, and offered
many insults, which neither the General Assembly of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Rhode-Island, nor the towns of Providence and Warwick,
could either prevent or punish. The government of Massachusetts,
and the commissioners of the united colonies,
refused to remedy these evils, unless Warwick would submit
to the jurisdiction of Plymouth or Massachusetts, and
finally the commissioners advised the Plymouth colony to
take possession of Warwick by force, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this distressed state of the colony, the separation occasioned
by Mr. Coddington’s measures would have been
ruinous. The only remedy was an immediate application
to the government in England, for the repeal of Mr. Coddington’s
charter, and the confirmation of that obtained by
Mr. Williams. For this purpose, Mr. John Clarke was requested
by citizens of Newport and Portsmouth<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c010'><sup>[277]</sup></a> to proceed
to England, as their agent. The towns of Providence
and Warwick urgently importuned Mr. Williams to
accompany Mr. Clarke on this important business. He
consented, though with reluctance, arising from a natural
unwillingness to leave his large family, (now consisting of
a wife and six children) and partly, we presume, from inability
to sustain the expense. He had not been remunerated
for his former agency, and he was now, it seems,
obliged, in order to raise funds, to sell his house at Narraganset,<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c010'><sup>[278]</sup></a>
notwithstanding that some efforts were made by
the people of Providence and Warwick to obtain a sufficient
sum by subscription. These facts we learn from the
following letter to Mr. Winthrop, and from a letter which
will next be quoted from William Arnold:</p>

<p class='c016'>“For my honored, kind friend, Mr. John Winthrop, at

<p class='c009'>Information of these designs was immediately communicated
by William Arnold to the Governor of Massachusetts.
The following letter, preserved in Hutchinson’s
Collection, is worthy of perusal, both from its connection
with Mr. Williams, and from the light which it throws on
the state of the times. Mr. Arnold, it will be seen, was
not disposed to look on any of the proceedings of Rhode-Island
with a favorable eye; and hence he accuses its inhabitants
of hostility to the united colonies, though facts
do not seem to sustain the charge, unless hostility was indicated
by a patient endurance of wrong, and by generous
services in time of danger.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Whereas Mr. Coddington has gotten a charter of
Rhode-Island and Canonicut Island to himself, he has

Shawomet, and that company of Providence, are gathering

that have given £10 and £20 a man, to help it forward
with speed; they say here is a fair inlet, and I hear
they have said, that if the Parliament do take displeasure
against Massachusetts, or the rest of the colonies, as they
have done against Barbadoes and other places, then this

whole country.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is great pity, and very unfit, that such a company as

is taken out from it, is but a strip of land lying in between
the colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth and Connecticut,

of it there may come some mischief and trouble upon

<p class='c016'>“I have hired this messenger on purpose. I humbly
desire to hear if this letter come safe to your hands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The town of Warwick addressed to the commissioners,
who met at New-Haven, September 4, 1651, a letter,<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c010'><sup>[280]</sup></a> in
which they unfolded the real condition of the town, and announced,
with calm dignity, their design to appeal to the
government of England. Mr. Arnold had written, in
haste, as if some secret plot had been fomented; but the
town thus gave seasonable notice to the commissioners, in
order that the other colonies might adopt measures, if they
pleased, to oppose and defeat this new embassy to England.
The inhabitants of Warwick felt a confidence in the justice
of their claims, and feared no opposition.</p>

<p class='c009'>This letter occasioned much debate among the commissioners.
Those of Massachusetts alleged, that Plymouth
had resigned to Massachusetts all its pretensions to Warwick,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>while the commissioners of Plymouth denied that
such a relinquishment had been made, and protested
against the proceedings of Massachusetts, in relation to
Warwick. This disagreement among themselves may be
received as one of the proofs, that neither party had any
just claims.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Williams and Mr. Clarke sail—Mr. Coddington’s charter vacated—troubles
in Rhode-Island—Mr. Williams returns—Sir Henry
Vane—Milton—Mr. Williams endeavors to re-establish order—Indians—letter
on religious and civil liberty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Williams and Mr. Clarke sailed from Boston for
England, in November, 1651. It was not without considerable
difficulty that Mr. Williams was allowed to take
passage at Boston. The object of his mission was offensive
to Massachusetts, besides the old dislike of his principles.</p>

<p class='c009'>During their absence, the towns of Newport and Portsmouth
submitted quietly to Mr. Coddington’s rule. Providence
and Warwick resolved to maintain the government,
as before established. They accordingly met by their
deputies, in General Assembly, at Providence, elected a
Governor, and enacted several laws, one of which prohibited
any person from purchasing land of the Indians, without
the approbation of the Assembly, on penalty of forfeiting
the same to the colony.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams and Mr. Clarke, on their arrival in England,
presented a petition to the Council of State, who, on
April 8, 1652, referred it to the committee for foreign
affairs. The application met with opposition, from various
sources; but the Council of State granted an order to
vacate Mr. Coddington’s commission, and to confirm the
former charter.</p>

<p class='c009'>While in England, in 1652, Mr. Clarke published a
book, entitled “III News from New-England, or a Narrative
of New-England’s Persecutions; wherein it is declared, that
while Old England is becoming New, New-England is
becoming Old; also, Four Proposals to Parliament, and
Four Conclusions, touching the Faith and Order of the
Gospel of Christ, out of his Last Will and Testament.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams also published, in 1652, his rejoinder to
Mr. Cotton, entitled “The Bloody Tenet yet More Bloody,
by Mr. Cotton’s Endeavor to Wash it White;” and two
essays, the one entitled “The Hireling Ministry None of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Christ’s, or a Discourse on the Propagation of the Gospel
of Jesus Christ;” and the other, “Experiments of Spiritual
Life and Health, and their Preservatives.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The following letter was written to Mr. Gregory Dexter,
who had printed Mr. Williams’ “Key,” during his first
visit to England, but who had subsequently removed to
Providence.</p>

<p class='c016'>“At Mr. Davis his house, at the Checker, in St. Martin’s,
or at Sir Henry Vane’s, at Whitehall.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>“My dear and faithful friend, to whom, with the dearest,
I humbly wish more and more of the light and love of him
who is invisible, God blessed for evermore in the face of
Jesus Christ. It hath pleased God so to engage me in
divers skirmishes against the priests, both of Old and New-England,
so that I have occasioned using the help of
printer men, unknown to me, to long for my old friend.
So it hath pleased God to hold open an open desire of
preaching and printing wonderfully against Romish and
English will-worship. At this present, the devil rageth and
clamors in petitions and remonstrances from the stationers
and others to the Parliament, and all cry, ‘shut up the
press.’ The stationers and others have put forth ‘The
Beacon Fired,’ and ‘The Second Beacon Fired;’ and some
friends of yours have put forth ‘The Beacon Quenched,’
not yet extant.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, many friends have frequently, with much love,
inquired after you. Mr. Warner is not yet come with my
letters: they put into Barnstable. She came by wagon by
land, but he goes with the ship to Bristol, and, indeed, in
this dangerous war with the Dutch, the only safe trading is
to Bristol, or those parts, for up along the channel, in London
way, is the greatest danger, for although our fleets be
abroad, and take many French and Dutch, yet they sometimes
catch up some of ours.</p>

<p class='c016'>“By my public letters, you will see how we wrestle, and
how we are like yet to wrestle, in the hopes of an end.
Praised be the Lord, we are preserved, the nation is preserved,
the Parliament sits, God’s people are secure, too
secure. A great opinion is, that the kingdom of Christ is
risen, and (Rev. 11:) ‘the kingdoms of the earth are become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ.’ Others
have fear of the slaughter of the witnesses yet approaching.
Divers friends, of all sorts, here, long to see you, and wonder
you come not over. For myself, I had hopes to have
got away by this ship, but I see now the mind of the Lord
to hold me here one year longer. It is God’s mercy, his
very great mercy, that we have obtained this interim encouragement
from the Council of State, that you may
cheerfully go on in the name of a colony, until the controversy
is determined. The determination of it, Sir, I fear,
will be a work of time, I fear longer than we have yet been
here, for our adversaries threaten to make a last appeal to
the Parliament, in case we get the day before the Council.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, in this regard, and when my public business is
over, I am resolved to begin my old law-suit, so that I have
no thought of return until spring come twelve months.
My duty and affection hath compelled me to acquaint my
poor companion with it. I consider our many children,
the danger of the seas, and enemies, and therefore I write
not positively for her, only I acquaint her with our affairs.
I tell her, joyful I should be of her being here with me,
until our state affairs were ended, and I freely leave her to
wait upon the Lord for direction, and according as she
finds her spirit free and cheerful, to come or stay. If it
please the Lord to give her a free spirit to cast herself upon
the Lord, I doubt not of your love and faithful care, in any
thing she hath occasion to use your help, concerning our
children and affairs, during our absence; but I conclude,
whom have I in heaven or earth but thee, and so humbly
and thankfully say, in the Lord’s pleasure, as only and infinitely
best and sweetest.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Abundance of love remembered from abundance of
friends to your dear self and your dearest.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My love to your cousin Clemence, and all desire love,

<p class='c016'>“To my dear and faithful friend, Mr. Gregory Dexter,
at Providence, in New-England, these.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The General Assembly, which met at Providence, in
October, addressed the following letter to Mr. Williams.
It is valuable, as a public testimonial of the affection of his
fellow-citizens. The proposition to procure for himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>from the government of England, an appointment as Governor
of the colony for one year, is a strong proof of their
respect and confidence, though this proposition was protested
against by some of them. Mr. Williams, we presume,
did not covet this distinction, and probably considered
such an appointment as a dangerous precedent, and a
virtual relinquishment of the authority given to the colony
by the charter to elect its own officers.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c017'>

we doubt not but will conduce to the peace and safety of
us all, as to make you once more an instrument to impart
and disclose our cause unto those noble and grave senators,
our honorable protectors, in whose eyes God hath given
you honor, (as we understand) beyond our hopes, and
moved the hearts of the wise to stir on your behalf. We give
you hearty thanks for your care and diligence, to watch all
opportunities to promote our peace, for we perceive your
prudent and comprehensive mind stirreth every stone to
present it to the builders, to make firm the fabric unto us,
about which you are employed, laboring to unweave such
irregular devices wrought by others amongst us, as have
formerly clothed us with so sad events, as the subjection of
some among us, both English and Indian, to other jurisdictions,
as also to prevent such near approach of our neighbors
upon our borders, on the Narraganset side, which
might much annoy us, with your endeavors to furnish us
with such ammunition as to look a foreign enemy in the

conceive (so far as we are able to understand) that if

the re-establishing of our government, that it might tend
much to the weighing of men’s minds, and subjecting of
persons who have been refractory, to yield themselves over
as unto a settled government, if it might be the pleasure of
that honorable state, to invest, appoint, and empower yourself
to come over as Governor of this colony, for the space
of one year, and so the government to be honorably put
upon this place, which might seem to add weight forever
hereafter in the constant and successive derivation of the
same. We only present it to your deliberate thoughts and
consideration, with our hearty desires that your time of
stay there for the effectual perfecting and finishing of your
so weighty affairs may not seem tedious, nor be any discouragement
unto you; rather than you shall suffer for
loss of time here, or expense there, we are resolved to
stretch forth our hands at your return, beyond our strength,
for your supply. Your loving bed-fellow is in health, and
presents her endeared affection, so are all your family.

<p class='c016'>“From the General Assembly of this colony of Providence
Plantations, assembled in the town of Providence,
the 28th of October, 1652.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“JOHN GREENE, <em>General Recorder</em>.”<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c010'><sup>[281]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The order of the Council of State was sent over by Mr.
William Dyre, who, perhaps, accompanied the agents to
England. This order directed the towns to unite again,
as before; but it was found, in this, as in other cases, easier
to command, than to enforce obedience. The towns seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>to have been jealous of each other, and tenacious of their
claims to precedence. It was found difficult to procure a
meeting, to adjust the government; the two towns on the
island insisting that the meeting should be held there, as
the largest part of the colony, while the towns of Providence
and Warwick made a similar claim, with the plausible
reason, that they had steadily adhered to the charter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The result was, either from mistake or from a rigid adherence
to etiquette, that two meetings were held. Mr.
Backus says:<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c010'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“The towns on the main met at Providence, May 17,
1653, and elected their officers. An assembly met at the
same time on the island, and chose Mr. Sanford their President,
and some freemen coming from the main, they chose
an assistant for each town in the colony; and they sent
Mr. James Barker and Mr. Richard Knight to Mr. Coddington,
to demand the statute book and book of records.
And as it was then a time of war betwixt England and
Holland, and a mention was made of it in the letters which
confirmed their charter, Dyre thought to make his advantage
thereby, and procured commissions for himself, Capt.
Underhill and Edward Hull, to act against the Dutch in
America; and some cannon, with twenty men, were sent
to the English, on the east end of Long-Island, to enable
them to act against the Dutch, who lay to the westward of
them. This alarmed Providence colony, who met again in
June, and a third time at Warwick, on August 13, when
they answered a letter from the Massachusetts, and remonstrated
against being drawn into a war with the Dutch;
and wrote to Mr. Williams an account of Dyre’s conduct,
and of their being urged to give up their former actings as
null; but, say they, ‘being still in the same order you left
us, and observing two great evils that such a course would
bring upon us: First, the hazard of involving in all the
disorders and bloodshed which have been committed on
Rhode-Island since their separation from us.’ Secondly,
‘the invading and frustrating of justice in divers weighty
causes, then orderly depending in our courts, in some of
which causes, Mr. Smith, President, William Field, &amp;c.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>were deeply concerned;’ therefore they could not yield to
such a motion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams and Mr. Clarke continued in England, endeavoring
to sustain the rights of the colony. They had
many opposers, but they found a steady and powerful friend
in Sir Henry Vane.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c010'><sup>[283]</sup></a> At his seat Mr. Williams spent a
portion of his time. While there, he wrote the following
letter to the towns of Providence and Warwick. It exhibits
his generous self-devotion for the public good, his
love for his family, and his characteristic regard for the
Indians:</p>

<p class='c016'>“From Sir Henry Vane’s, at Belleau, in Lincolnshire.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>April 1st, 53, (so called.)</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“My dear and loving friends and neighbors of Providence
and Warwick, our noble friend, Sir Henry Vane,
having the navy of England mostly depending on his care,
and going down to the navy at Portsmouth, I was invited
by them both to accompany his lady to Lincolnshire, where
I shall yet stay, as I fear, until the ship is gone. I must
therefore pray your pardon, that by the post I send this to
London. I hope it may have pleased the Most High Lord
of sea and land to bring Capt. Ch-rst-n’s ship and dear
Mr. Dyre unto you, and with him the Council’s letters,
which answer the petition Sir Henry Vane and myself
drew up, and the Council, by Sir Henry’s mediation, granted
us, for the confirmation of the charter, until the determination
of the controversy. This determination, you may
please to understand, is hindered by two main obstructions.
The first is the mighty war with the Dutch, which makes
England and Holland and the nations tremble. This hath
made the Parliament set Sir Henry Vane and two or three
more as commissioners to manage the war, which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>have done, with much engaging the name of God with
them, who hath appeared in helping sixty of ours against
almost three hundred of their men-of-war, and perchance
to the sinking and taking about one hundred of theirs, and
but one of ours, which was sunk by our own men. Our
second obstruction is the opposition of our adversaries, Sir
Arthur Haselrig and Col. Fenwicke, who hath married his
daughter, Mr. Winslow, and Mr. Hopkins, both in great
place; and all the friends they can make in Parliament
and Council, and all the priests, both Presbyterian and Independent;
so that we stand as two armies, ready to engage,
observing the motions and postures each of the other,
and yet shy each of other. Under God, the sheet-anchor
of our ship is Sir Henry, who will do as the eye of God
leads him, and he faithfully promised me that he would observe
the motion of our New-England business, while I
staid some ten weeks with his lady in Lincolnshire. Besides,
here is great thoughts and preparation for a new
Parliament; some of our friends are apt to think another
Parliament will more favor us and our cause than this has
done. You may please to put my condition into your soul’s
cases; remember I am a father and a husband. I have
longed earnestly to return with the last ship, and with
these, yet I have not been willing to withdraw my shoulders
from the burthen, lest it pinch others, and may fall heavy
upon all; except you are pleased to give to me a discharge.
If you conceive it necessary for me still to attend this service,
pray you consider if it be not convenient that my poor
wife be encouraged to come over to me, and to wait together
on the good pleasure of God for the end of this matter.
You know my many weights hanging on me, how my
own place stands, and how many reasons I have to cause
me to make haste, yet I would not lose their estates, peace
and liberty, by leaving hastily. I write to my dear wife,
my great desire of her coming while I stay, yet left it to the
freedom of her spirit, because of the many dangers; truly,
at present the seas are dangerous, but not comparably so
much, nor likely to be, because of the late great defeat of
the Dutch, and their present sending to us offers of peace.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear friends, although it pleased God himself, by
many favors, to encourage me, yet please you to remember,
that no man can stay here as I do, leaving a present employment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>there, without much self-denial, which I beseech
God for more, and for you also, that no private respects, or
gains, or quarrels, may cause you to neglect the public and
common safety, peace and liberties. I beseech the blessed
God to keep fresh in your thoughts what he hath done for
Providence Plantations.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear respects to yourselves, wives and children. I
beseech the eternal God to be seen amongst you; so prays
your most faithful and affectionate friend and servant,</p>

<p class='c009'>The difficulties in the colony continued, and were artfully
fomented by uneasy men, who thought disorder more
propitious to their interests than the stable dominion of law
and good government. Mr. Williams felt that his presence
was needed at home, that he might, if possible, bring
the discordant towns into harmonious co-operation. He
therefore left Mr. Clarke in England, to prosecute the duties
of their mission, and returned, early in the summer of
1654. He landed at Boston, and being furnished with
an order from the Lord Protector’s Council, requiring the
government of Massachusetts to allow him in future to embark
or land in their territories, he was not molested. He
brought the following letter from Sir Henry Vane, addressed
to the inhabitants of the colony of Rhode-Island:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Loving and Christian friends,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I could not refuse this bearer, Mr. Roger Williams,
my kind friend and ancient acquaintance, to be accompanied
with these few lines from myself to you, upon his return
to Providence colony; though, perhaps, my private
and retired condition, which the Lord, of his mercy, hath
brought me into, might have argued strongly enough for
my silence; but, indeed, something I hold myself bound
to say to you, out of the Christian love I bear you, and for
his sake whose name is called upon by you and engaged
in your behalf. How is it that there are such divisions
amongst you? Such headiness, tumults, disorders, injustice?
The noise echoes into the ears of all, as well
friends as enemies, by every return of ships from those
parts. Is not the fear and awe of God amongst you to restrain?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Is not the love of Christ in you, to fill you with
yearning bowels, one towards another, and constrain you
not to live to yourselves, but to him that died for you, yea,
and is risen again? Are there no wise men amongst you?
No public self-denying spirits, that at least, upon the
grounds of public safety, equity and prudence, can find out
some way or means of union and reconciliation for you
amongst yourselves, before you become a prey to common
enemies, especially since this state, by the last letter from
the Council of State, give you your freedom, as supposing
a better use would have been made of it than there hath
been? Surely, when kind and simple remedies are applied
and are ineffectual, it speaks loud and broadly the
high and dangerous distempers of such a body, as if the
wounds were incurable. But I hope better things from
you, though I thus speak, and should be apt to think, that
by commissioners agreed on and appointed on all parts,
and on behalf of all interests, in a general meeting, such a
union and common satisfaction might arise, as, through
God’s blessing, might put a stop to your growing breaches
and distractions, silence your enemies, encourage your
friends, honor the name of God, (which of late hath been
much blasphemed, by reason of you,) and in particular, refresh
and revive the sad heart of him who mourns over
your present evils, as being your affectionate friend, to
serve you in the Lord.</p>

pillar in these parts, and of your healths, your own, Mrs.
Winthrop, and your branches, although some sad mixtures
we have had from the sad tidings (if true) of the late loss
and cutting off of one of them.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I was lately upon the wing to have waited on you
at your house. I had disposed all for my journey, and my
staff was in my hand, but it pleased the Lord to interpose
some impediments, so that I am compelled to a suspension
for a season, and choose at present thus to visit you. I
had no letters for you, but yours were well. I was at the
lodgings of Major Winthrop and Mr. Peters, but I missed
them. Your brother flourisheth in good esteem, and is
eminent for maintaining the freedom of the conscience as
to matters of belief, religion and worship. Your father
Peters<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c010'><sup>[286]</sup></a> preacheth the same doctrine, though not so zealously
as some years since, yet cries out against New-English
rigidities and persecutions, their civil injuries and wrongs
to himself, and their unchristian dealing with him, in excommunicating
his distracted wife. All this he told me in
his lodgings, at Whitehall, those lodgings which I was told
were Canterbury’s; but he himself told me, that that library,
wherein we were together, was Canterbury’s, and given
him by the Parliament. His wife lives from him not
wholly, but much distracted. He tells me he had but two
hundred a year, and he allowed her fourscore per annum
of it. Surely, Sir, the most holy Lord is most wise in all
the trials he exerciseth his people with. He told me that
his affliction from his wife stirred him up to action abroad,
and when success tempted him to pride, the bitterness in
his bosom comforts was a cooler and a bridle to him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Surely, Sir, your father, and all the people of God in
England, formerly called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Puritanus Anglicanus</span></i>, of late
<em>Roundheads</em>, now the <em>Sectarians</em>, (as more or less cut off

<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Richard III., &amp;c. So did many think of the last Parliament,
who were of the vote of fifty-six against priests and
tithes, opposite to the vote of the fifty-four who were for
them, at least for a while. Major Gen. Harrison was the
second in the nation of late, when the loving General and
himself joined against the former Long Parliament and dissolved
them, but now being the head of the fifty-six party,
he was confined by the Protector and Council, within five
miles of his father’s house, in Staffordshire. That sentence
he not obeying, he told me (the day before my leaving
London) he was to be sent prisoner into Harfordshire.
Surely, Sir, he is a very gallant, most deserving, heavenly
man, but most high flown for the kingdom of the saints,
and the fifth monarchy now risen, and their sun never to
set again, &amp;c. Others, as to my knowledge, the Protector,
Lord President Lawrence, and others at helm, with Sir
Henry Vane, (retired into Lincolnshire, yet daily missed
and courted for his assistance) are not so full of that faith
of miracles, but still imagine changes and persecutions and
the very slaughter of the witnesses, before that glorious
morning so much desired of a worldly kingdom, if ever
such a kingdom (as literally it is by so many expounded)
be to arise in this present world and dispensation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I know not how far your judgment hath concurred
with the design against the Dutch. I must acknowledge
my mourning for it, and when I heard of it, at Portsmouth,
I confess I wrote letters to the Protector and President,
from thence, as against a most uningenuous and unchristian
design, at such a time, when the world stood gazing at the
so famous treaty for peace, which was then between the
two States, and near finished when we set sail. Much I
can tell you of the answer I had from Court, and I think
of the answers I had from heaven, viz. that the Lord would
graciously retard us until the tidings of peace (from England)
might quench the fire in the kindling of it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I mourn that any of our parts were so madly injurious
to trouble yours. I pity poor Sabando. I yet have
hopes in God that we shall be more loving and peaceable
neighbors. I had word from the Lord President to Portsmouth,
that the Council had passed three letters as to our
business. First, to encourage us; second, to our neighbor
colonies not to molest us; third, in exposition of that word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>dominion, in the late frame of the government of England,
viz. that liberty of conscience should be maintained in all
American plantations, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, a great man in America told me, that he thought
New-England would not bear it. I hope better, and that
not only the necessity, but the equity, piety and Christianity
of that freedom will more and more shine forth, not to
licentiousness, (as all mercies are apt to be abused) but to
the beauty of Christianity and the lustre of true faith in
God and love to poor mankind, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I have desires of keeping home. I have long had
scruples of selling the natives aught but what may bring
or tend to civilizing; I therefore neither brought, nor shall
sell them, loose coats nor breeches. It pleased the Lord
to call me for some time, and with some persons, to practise
the Hebrew, the Greek, Latin, French and Dutch.
The Secretary of the Council, (Mr. Milton) for my Dutch
I read him, read me many more languages. Grammar
rules begin to be esteemed a tyranny. I taught two young
gentlemen, a Parliament man’s sons, as we teach our children
English, by words, phrases and constant talk, &amp;c. I
have begun with mine own three boys, who labor besides;
others are coming to me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I shall rejoice to receive a word of your healths,
of the Indian wars, and to be ever yours,</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I pray seal and send the enclosed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Among other remarkable passages, in the foregoing letter,
the allusion to Milton is not the least interesting. He
was then the Secretary of the government, and in that
office he honored the English name, by his eloquent writings
in defence of liberty. Mr. Williams was naturally attracted
to a communion with the lofty spirit of Milton. His
was a kindred mind, imbued with the same love of liberty,
and alike free from selfish ends. Both encountered persecution,
and endured poverty for their principles. They
both acted in the same spirit of self-sacrifice for the good
of others; and Mr. Williams might have used, with equal
truth and propriety, the magnanimous and almost triumphant
language of Milton, in his sonnet on the loss of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>his sight, which was hastened by his intense application to
his noble “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Defensio pro Populo Anglicano</span>.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

      <div class='line'>Right onward.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The preceding letter bears an incidental testimony to
the various learning of Milton, and it implies, that Mr.
Williams was sufficiently versed in the Hebrew, Greek,
Latin, Dutch and French languages, to teach them. It
shows, moreover, that, like Milton himself, and Dr. Johnson,
and other distinguished men, Mr. Williams employed
himself in the honorable office of an instructor of youth;
an office worthy of the most gifted mind, and which ranks,
in the estimate of sober reason, second to no other function,
except that of the teacher of religion. This fact is the
more honorable to Mr. Williams, because he became a
teacher, as a means of subsistence, while he was serving
his colony in England.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c010'><sup>[287]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>In the following letter to the town of Providence, Mr.
Williams alludes, in affecting terms, to his toils and sacrifices,
and to the ungrateful requital with which they had
been met by some individuals:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Well beloved friends and neighbors,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I am like a man in a great fog. I know not well how
to steer. I fear to run upon the rocks at home, having had
trials abroad. I fear to run quite backward, as men in a
mist do, and undo all that I have been a long time undoing
myself to do, viz. to keep up the name of a people, a free
people, not enslaved to the bondages and iron yokes of the
great (both soul and body) oppressions of the English and
barbarians about us, nor to the divisions and disorders
within ourselves. Since I set the first step of any English
foot into these wild parts, and have maintained a chargeable
and hazardous correspondence with the barbarians, and
spent almost five years’ time with the state of England, to
keep off the rage of the English against us, what have I
reaped of the root of being the stepping-stone of so many
families and towns about us, but grief, and sorrow, and
bitterness? I have been charged with folly for that freedom
and liberty which I have always stood for; I say liberty
and equality, both in land and government. I have
been blamed for parting with Moshassuck, and afterward
Pawtuxet, (which were mine own as truly as any man’s coat
upon his back,) without reserving to myself a foot of land,
or an inch of voice in any matter, more than to my servants
and strangers. It hath been told me that I labored for a
licentious and contentious people; that I have foolishly
parted with town and colony advantages, by which I might
have preserved both town and colony in as good order as
any in the country about us. This, and ten times more, I
have been censured for, and at this present am called a
traitor, by one party, against the state of England, for not
maintaining the charter and the colony; and it is said that
I am as good as banished by yourselves, and that both sides
wished that I might never have landed, that the fire of contention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>might have had no stop in burning. Indeed, the
words have been so sharp between myself and some lately,
that at last I was forced to say, they might well silence all
complaints if I once began to complain, who was unfortunately
fetched and drawn from my employment, and sent
to so vast distance from my family, to do your work of a
high and costly nature, for so many days and weeks and
months together, and there left to starve, or steal, or beg or
borrow. But blessed be God, who gave me favor to borrow
one while, and to work another, and thereby to pay your
debts there, and to come over with your credit and honor,
as an agent from you, who had, in your name, grappled
with the agents and friends of all your enemies round about
you. I am told that your opposites thought on me, and
provided, as I may say, a sponge to wipe off your scores
and debts in England, but that it was obstructed by yourselves,
who rather meditated on means and new agents to be
sent over, to cross what Mr. Clarke and I obtained. But,
gentlemen, blessed be God, who faileth not, and blessed be
his name for his wonderful <span class='sc'>Providences</span>, by which alone
this town and colony, and that grand cause of <span class='sc'>Truth and
Freedom of Conscience</span>, hath been upheld to this day.
And blessed be his name who hath again quenched so
much of our fires hitherto, and hath brought your names
and his own name thus far out of the dirt of scorn, reproach,
&amp;c. I find among yourselves and your opposites
that of Solomon true, that the contentions of brethren
(some that lately were so) are the bars of a castle, and not
easily broken; and I have heard some of both sides zealously
talking of undoing themselves by a trial in England.
Truly, friends, I cannot but fear you lost a fair wind lately,
when this town was sent to for its deputies, and you were
not pleased to give an overture unto the rest of the inhabitants
about it; yea, and when yourselves thought that I invited
you to some conference tending to reconciliation, before
the town should act in so fundamental a business, you
were pleased to forestall that, so that being full of grief,
shame and astonishment, yea, and fear that all that is now
done, especially in our town of Providence, is but provoking
the spirits of men to fury and desperation, I pray your
leave to pray you to remember (that which I lately told your
opposites) <em>only by pride cometh contention</em>. If there be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>humility on the one side, yet there is pride on the other, and
certainly the eternal God will engage against the proud. I
therefore pray you to examine, as I have done them, your
proceedings in this first particular. Secondly, Love covereth
a multitude of sins. Surely your charges and complaints
each against other, have not hid nor covered any thing,
as we use to cover the nakedness of those we love. If you
will now profess not to have disfranchised humanity and
love, but that, as David in another case, you will sacrifice
to the common peace, and common safety, and common
credit, that which may be said to cost you something, I
pray your loving leave to tell you, that if I were in your
soul’s case, I would send unto your opposites such a line as
this: ‘Neighbors, at the constant request, and upon the
constant mediation which our neighbor Roger Williams,
since his arrival, hath used to us, both for pacification and
accommodation of our sad differences, and also upon the
late endeavors in all the other towns for an union, we are
persuaded to remove our obstruction, viz. that paper of contention
between us, and to deliver it into the hands of our
aforesaid neighbor, and to obliterate that order, which that
paper did occasion. This removed, you may be pleased to
meet with, and debate freely, and vote in all matters with
us, as if such grievances had not been amongst us. Secondly,
if yet aught remain grievous, which we ourselves,
by free debate and conference, cannot compose, we offer to
be judged and censured by four men, which out of any part
of the colony you shall choose two, and we the other.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gentlemen, I only add, that I crave your loving pardon
to your bold but true friend,</p>

<p class='c009'>The pathetic earnestness, and conciliatory yet dignified
tone of this letter, produced a favorable effect. At a town
meeting held in Providence, in August, Mr. Williams was
requested to prepare an answer to Sir Henry Vane’s letter,
in the name of the town. This answer, dated August 27,
1654, is as follows. It bears the characteristics of Mr.
Williams’ style, and it expresses his opinions of certain
public men and measures:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sir,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Although we are aggrieved at your late retirement from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>the helm of public affairs, yet we rejoice to reap the sweet
fruits of your rest in your pious and loving lines, most seasonably
sent unto us. Thus the sun, when he retires his
brightness from the world, yet from under the very clouds
we perceive his presence, and enjoy some light and heat
and sweet refreshings. Sir, your letters were directed to
all and every particular town of this Providence colony.
Surely, Sir, among the many providences of the Most High,
towards this town of Providence, and this Providence colony,
we cannot but see apparently his gracious hand, providing
your honorable self for so noble and true a friend to an
outcast and despised people. From the first beginning of
this Providence colony, occasioned by the banishment of
some in this place from the Massachusetts, we say ever
since to this very day, we have reaped the sweet fruits of
your constant loving kindness and favor towards us. Oh,
Sir, whence, then, is it that you have bent your bow, and
shot your sharp and bitter arrows now against us? Whence
is it that you charge us with divisions, disorders, &amp;c.? Sir,
we humbly pray your gentle acceptance of our two fold
answer.</p>

<p class='c016'>“First, we have been greatly disturbed and distracted by
the ambition and covetousness of some amongst us. Sir,
we were in complete order, until Mr. Coddington, wanting
that public, self-denying spirit which you commend to us in
your letter, procured, by most untrue information, a monopoly
of part of the colony, viz. Rhode-Island, to himself,
and so occasioned our general disturbance and distractions.
Secondly, Mr. Dyre, with no less want of a public spirit,
being ruined by party contentions with Mr. Coddington,
and being betrusted to bring from England the letters of
the Council of State for our re-unitings, he hopes for a recruit
to himself by other men’s goods; and, contrary to
the State’s intentions and expressions, plungeth himself and
some others in most unnecessary and unrighteous plundering,
both of Dutch and French, and English also, to our
great grief, who protested against such abuse of our power
from England; and the end of it is to the shame and reproach
of himself, and the very English name, as all these
parts do witness.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, our second answer is, (that we may not lay all the
load upon other men’s backs,) that possibly a sweet cup hath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>rendered many of us wanton and too active, for we have
long drunk of the cup of as great liberties as any people
that we can hear of under the whole heaven. We have
not only been long free (together with all New-England)
from the iron yoke of wolvish bishops, and their popish
ceremonies, (against whose cruel oppressions God raised
up your noble spirit in Parliament,) but we have sitten
quiet and dry from the streams of blood spilt by that war
in our native country. We have not felt the new chains
of the Presbyterian tyrants, nor in this colony have we
been consumed with the over-zealous fire of the (so called)
godly christian magistrates. Sir, we have not known what
an excise means; we have almost forgotten what tythes are,
yea, or taxes either, to church or commonwealth. We
could name other special privileges, ingredients of our
sweet cup, which your great wisdom knows to be very
powerful (except more than ordinary watchfulness) to render
the best of men wanton and forgetful. But, blessed be
your love, and your loving heart and hand, awakening any
of our sleepy spirits by your sweet alarm; and blessed be
your noble family, root and branch, and all your pious and
prudent engagements and retirements. We hope you shall
no more complain of the saddening of your loving heart
by the men of Providence town or of Providence colony,
but that when we are gone and rotten, our posterity and
children after us shall read in our town records your pious
and favorable letters and loving kindness to us, and this
our answer, and real endeavor after peace and righteousness;
and to be found, Sir, your most obliged, and most
humble servants, the town of Providence, in Providence
colony, in New-England.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The town of Providence, at the instance of Mr. Williams,
and the other towns, as we may presume, by his influence,
appointed commissioners, who met on the 31st of
August, and re-established the government on its old
foundations.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c010'><sup>[288]</sup></a> They appointed a general election, to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>held at Warwick, on the 12th of September, at which Mr.
Williams was chosen President of the colony, and, together
with Mr. Gregory Dexter, was requested to “draw forth
and send letters of humble thanksgiving to his Highness,
the Lord Protector, and Sir Henry Vane, Mr. Holland,
and Mr. John Clarke, in the name of the colony; and Mr.
Williams is desired to subscribe them, by virtue of his
office.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By the wisdom, and the firm yet healing gentleness of
Mr. Williams, was the colony thus re-united, after a disorderly
interval of several years. The little bark was
rescued from the rocks which threatened her destruction,
and once more launched forth, her faithful pilot at the
helm, and her banner, displaying her chosen motto
“Hope,” floating again upon the breeze.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c010'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The following letter to the government of Massachusetts,
alludes to some disturbances with the Indians, which occurred
about this time. Ninigret, the Niantick sachem,
had made war with the Indians of Long Island,<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c010'><sup>[290]</sup></a> and was
supposed to be in alliance with the Dutch at New-York.
The commissioners of the united colonies sent a considerable
force against Ninigret, under the command of Major
Willard, of Massachusetts, but they returned without
success, the sachem and his warriors having taken refuge
in a swamp. The real cause, perhaps, why the war was
not vigorously waged, was, that Massachusetts was opposed
to hostilities, and with a wisdom and humanity which honored
her rulers, prevented at this time, as she had done on
a former occasion, a general war with the natives.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c010'><sup>[291]</sup></a> We may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>hope, that the admirable letter of Mr. Williams had some
effect in producing this pacific temper:</p>

<p class='c016'>“I truly wish you peace, and pray your gentle acceptance
of a word, I hope not unreasonable.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We have in these parts a sound of your meditations of
war against these natives, amongst whom we dwell. I
consider that war is one of those three great, sore plagues,
with which it pleaseth God to affect the sons of men. I
consider, also, that I refused, lately, many offers in my native
country, out of a sincere desire to seek the good and
peace of this.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I remember, that upon the express advice of your ever
honored Mr. Winthrop, deceased,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c010'><sup>[292]</sup></a> I first adventured to
begin a plantation among the thickest of these barbarians.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That in the Pequod wars, it pleased your honored government
to employ me in the hazardous and weighty service
of negotiating a league between yourselves and the
Narragansets, when the Pequod messengers, who sought
the Narragansets’ league against the English, had almost
ended that my work and life together.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That at the subscribing of that solemn league, which,
by the mercy of the Lord, I had procured with the Narragansets,
your government was pleased to send unto me the
copy of it, subscribed by all hands there, which yet I keep
as a monument and a testimony of peace and faithfulness
between you both.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That, since that time, it hath pleased the Lord so to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>order it, that I have been more or less interested and
used in all your great transactions of war or peace, between
the English and the natives, and have not spared
purse, nor pains, nor hazards, (very many times,) that the
whole land, English and natives, might sleep in peace securely.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That in my last negotiations in England, with the Parliament,
Council of State, and his Highness,<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c010'><sup>[293]</sup></a> I have
been forced to be known so much, that if I should be
silent, I should not only betray mine own peace and yours,
but also should be false to their honorable and princely
names, whose loves and affections, as well as their supreme
authority, are not a little concerned in the peace or war of
this country.</p>

<p class='c016'>“At my last departure for England, I was importuned by
the Narraganset sachems, and especially by Ninigret, to
present their petition to the high sachems of England, that
they might not be forced from their religion, and, for not
changing their religion, be invaded by war; for they said
they were daily visited with threatenings by Indians that
came from about the Massachusetts, that if they would
not pray, they should be destroyed by war. With this
their petition I acquainted, in private discourses, divers of
the chief of our nation, and especially his Highness, who,
in many discourses I had with him, never expressed the
least tittle of displeasure, as hath been here reported, but,
in the midst of disputes, ever expressed a high spirit of
love and gentleness, and was often pleased to please himself
with very many questions, and my answers, about the
Indian affairs of this country; and, after all hearing of
yourself and us, it hath pleased his Highness and his
Council to grant, amongst other favors to this colony, some
expressly concerning the very Indians, the native inhabitants
of this jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I, therefore, humbly offer to your prudent and impartial
view, first, these two considerable terms, it pleased the
Lord to use to all that profess his name (Rom. 12: 18,) if
it be possible, and all men.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I never was against the righteous use of the civil
sword of men or nations, but yet since all men of conscience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>or prudence ply to windward, to maintain their
wars to be defensive, (as did both King and Scotch, and
English, and Irish too, in the late wars,) I humbly pray
your consideration, whether it be not only possible, but
very easy, to live and die in peace with all the natives of
this country.</p>

<p class='c016'>“For, secondly, are not all the English of this land,
generally, a persecuted people from their native soil? and
hath not the God of peace and Father of mercies made
these natives more friendly in this, than our native countrymen
in our own land to us? Have they not entered
leagues of love, and to this day continued peaceable commerce
with us? Are not our families grown up in peace
amongst them? Upon which I humbly ask, how it can
suit with Christian ingenuity to take hold of some seeming
occasions for their destructions, which, though the heads
be only aimed at, yet, all experience tells us, falls on the
body and the innocent.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Thirdly, I pray it may be remembered how greatly the
name of God is concerned in this affair, for it cannot be
hid, how all England and other nations ring with the glorious
conversion of the Indians of New-England. You
know how many books are dispersed throughout the nation,
of the subject, (in some of them the Narraganset
chief sachems are publicly branded, for refusing to pray
and be converted;) have all the pulpits in England been
commanded to sound of this glorious work, (I speak not
ironically, but only mention what all the printed books
mention,) and that, by the highest command and authority
of Parliament, and church wardens went from house to
house, to gather supplies for this work.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Honored Sirs,</div>

<p class='c016'>“Whether I have been and am a friend to the natives’
turning to civility and Christianity, and whether I have
been instrumental, and desire so to be, according to my
light, I will not trouble you with; only I beseech you consider,
how the name of the most holy and jealous God may
be preserved between the clashings of these two, viz: the
glorious conversion of the Indians in New-England, and
the unnecessary wars and cruel destructions of the Indians
in New-England.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Fourthly, I beseech you forget not, that although we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>are apt to play with this plague of war more than with the
other two, famine and pestilence, yet I beseech you consider
how the present events of all wars that ever have
been in the world, have been wonderful fickle, and the
future calamities and revolutions, wonderful in the latter
end.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Heretofore, not having liberty of taking ship in your
jurisdiction, I was forced to repair unto the Dutch, where
mine eyes did see that first breaking forth of that Indian
war, which the Dutch begun, upon the slaughter of some
Dutch by the Indians; and they questioned not to finish
it in a few days, insomuch that the name of peace, which
some offered to mediate, was foolish and odious to them.
But before we weighed anchor, their bowries were in
flames; Dutch and English were slain. Mine eyes saw
their flames at their towns, and the flights and hurries of
men, women and children, the present removal of all that
could for Holland; and, after vast expenses, and mutual
slaughters of Dutch, English, and Indians, about four
years, the Dutch were forced, to save their plantation from
ruin, to make up a most unworthy and dishonorable peace
with the Indians.</p>

<p class='c016'>“How frequently is that saying in England, that both
Scotch and English had better have borne loans, ship
money, &amp;c. than run upon such rocks, that even success
and victory have proved, and are yet like to prove.
Yea, this late war with Holland, however begun with zeal
against God’s enemies, as some in Parliament said, yet
what fruits brought it forth, but the breach of the Parliament,
the enraging of the nation by taxes, the ruin of
thousands who depended on manufactures and merchandize,
the loss of many thousand seamen, and others, many
of whom many worlds are not worthy?</p>

<p class='c016'>“But, lastly, if any be yet zealous of kindling this fire
for God, &amp;c. I beseech that gentleman, whoever he be, to
lay himself in the opposite scale, with one of the fairest
buds that ever the sun of righteousness cherished, Josiah,
that most zealous and melting-hearted reformer, who would
to war, and against warnings, and fell in most untimely
death and lamentations, and now stands, a pillar of salt to
all succeeding generations.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, with your patience, a word to these nations at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>war, (occasion of yours,) the Narragansets and Long-Islanders,
I know them both experimentally, and therefore
pray you to remember,</p>

<p class='c016'>“First, that the Narragansets and Mohawks are the two
great bodies of Indians in this country, and they are confederates,
and long have been, and they both yet are
friendly and peaceable to the English. I do humbly conceive,
that if ever God calls us to a just war with either of
them, he calls us to make sure of the one to a friend. It
is true some distaste was lately here amongst them, but they
parted friends, and some of the Narragansets went home
with them, and I fear that both these and the Long-Islanders
and Mohegans, and all the natives of the land, may,
upon the sound of a defeat of the English, be induced
easily to join each with other against us.</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. The Narragansets, as they were the first, so they
have been long confederates with you; they have been
true, in all the Pequod wars, to you. They occasioned the
Mohegans to come in, too, and so occasioned the Pequods’
downfall.</p>

<p class='c016'>“3. I cannot yet learn, that ever it pleased the Lord to
permit the Narragansets to stain their hands with any
English blood, neither in open hostilities nor secret murders,
as both Pequods and Long-Islanders did, and Mohegans
also, in the Pequod wars. It is true they are barbarians,
but their greatest offences against the English have
been matters of money, or petty revenging of themselves
on some Indians, upon extreme provocations, but God kept
them clear of our blood.</p>

<p class='c016'>“4. For the people, many hundred English have experimented
them to be inclined to peace and love with the
English nation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Their late famous long-lived Canonicus so lived and
died, and in the same most honorable manner and solemnity
(in their way) as you laid to sleep your prudent peace-maker,
Mr. Winthrop, did they honor this, their prudent
and peaceable prince. His son, Mexham<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c010'><sup>[294]</sup></a>, inherits his
spirit. Yea, through all their towns and countries, how
frequently do many, and oft-times one Englishman, travel
alone with safety and loving kindness!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“The cause and root of all the present mischief, is the
pride of two barbarians, Ascassassotic, the Long-Island
sachem, and Ninigret, of the Narraganset. The former
is proud and foolish; the latter is proud and fierce. I
have not seen him these many years, yet from their sober
men I hear he pleads,</p>

<p class='c016'>“First, that Ascassassotic, a very inferior sachem, bearing
himself upon the English, hath slain three or four of
his people, and since that, sent him challenges and darings
to fight, and mend himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. He, Ninigret, consulted, by solemn messengers,
with the chief of the English Governors, Major Endicott,
then Governor of the Massachusetts, who sent him an implicit
consent to right himself, upon which they all plead
that the English have just occasion of displeasure.</p>

<p class='c016'>“3. After he had taken revenge upon the Long-Islanders,
and brought away about fourteen captives, divers of
their chief women, yet he restored them all again, upon
the mediation and desire of the English.</p>

<p class='c016'>“4. After this peace made, the Long-Islanders, pretending
to visit Ninigret, at Block-Island, slaughtered of his
Narragansets near thirty persons, at midnight, two of them
of great note, especially Wepiteammoc’s son, to whom
Ninigret was uncle.</p>

<p class='c016'>“5. In the prosecution of this war, although he had
drawn down the Islanders to his assistance, yet, upon protestation
of the English against his proceedings, he
retreated, and dissolved his army.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Honored Sirs,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“1. I know it is said the Long-Islanders are subjects;
but I have heard this greatly questioned, and, indeed, I
question whether any Indians in this country, remaining
barbarous and pagan, may with truth or honor be called
the English subjects.</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. But grant them subjects, what capacity hath their late
massacre of the Narragansets, with whom they had made
peace, without the English consent, though still under the
English name, put them into?</p>

<p class='c016'>“3. All Indians are extremely treacherous; and if to
their own nation, for private ends, revolting to strangers,
what will they do upon the sound of one defeat of the
English, or the trade of killing English cattle, and persons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>and plunder, which will, most certainly be the trade, if any
considerable party escape alive, as mine eyes beheld in the
Dutch war.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But, I beseech you, say your thoughts and the thoughts
of your wives and little ones, and the thoughts of all English,
and of God’s people in England, and the thoughts of his
Highness and Council, (tender of these parts,) if, for the sake
of a few inconsiderable pagans, and beasts, wallowing in
idleness, stealing, lying, whoring, treacherous witchcrafts,
blasphemies, and idolatries, all that the gracious hand of
the Lord hath so wonderfully planted in the wilderness,
should be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“How much nobler were it, and glorious to the name
of God and your own, that no pagan should dare to use the
name of an English subject, who comes not out, in some
degree, from barbarism to civility, in forsaking their filthy
nakedness, in keeping some kind of cattle, which yet your
councils and commands may tend to, and, as pious and
prudent deceased Mr. Winthrop said, that civility may be
a leading step to Christianity, is the humble desire of your
most unfeigned in all services of love,</p>

      <div class='line'><em>of Providence colony</em>,</div>
      <div class='line in20'><em>President</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Though Mr. Williams had succeeded in restoring the
regular operation of the government, there were not wanting
individuals who were uneasy and restive under restraints.
A person, about this time, sent a paper to the
town of Providence, affirming “that it was blood-guiltiness,
and against the rule of the Gospel, to execute judgment
upon transgressors against the private or public weal.”
This principle struck at the foundation of all civil society.
There were, as we may easily suppose, some individuals,
who had been drawn to Rhode-Island by the prospect of
enjoying liberty, and who would gladly have cast off all
restraint, and revelled in unbounded license.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams could not remain silent, while such sentiments
were avowed. He accordingly wrote the following
letter to the town. It is, in every respect, worthy of him.
It presents, briefly, his principles of civil and religious liberty,
illustrated by a happy comparison, and carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>guarded by limitations, exact, clear, and in harmony with
the dictates of reason and Scripture. The duty of civil
obedience is maintained, as decisively as Mr. Cotton himself
could have wished; while the rights of conscience are
declared, with a precision, an enlarged comprehension of
mind, and a liberality of feeling, of which no other example
could be found at that early day. This letter is a sufficient
reply to all the allegations against Mr. Williams of a
spirit hostile to the civil peace; and it may be added, that
the church which he founded at Providence, and all the
churches of the same faith which have since multiplied
over the land, have maintained precisely the same views of
civil and religious duties and rights:</p>

<p class='c016'>“That ever I should speak or write a tittle that tends to
such an infinite liberty of conscience, is a mistake, and
which I have ever disclaimed and abhorred. To prevent
such mistakes, I at present shall only propose this case:
There goes many a ship to sea, with many hundred souls
in one ship, whose weal and woe is common, and is a true
picture of a commonwealth, or a human combination or
society. It hath fallen out sometimes that both Papists
and Protestants, Jews and Turks, may be embarked in one
ship; upon which supposal I affirm, that all the liberty of
conscience, that ever I pleaded for, turns upon these two
hinges: that none of the Papists, Protestants, Jews or
Turks, be forced to come to the ship’s prayers or worship,
nor compelled from their own particular prayers or worship,
if they practise any. I further add, that I never denied,
that notwithstanding this liberty, the commander of this
ship ought to command the ship’s course, yea, and also
command that justice, peace and sobriety be kept and
practised, both among the seamen and all the passengers.
If any of the seamen refuse to perform their service, or
passengers to pay their freight; if any refuse to help, in
person or purse, towards the common charges or defence;
if any refuse to obey the common laws and orders of the
ship, concerning their common peace or preservation; if
any shall mutiny and rise up against their commanders
and officers; if any should preach or write that there
ought to be no commanders or officers, because all are
equal in Christ, therefore no masters nor officers, nor laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>nor orders, no corrections nor punishments; I say, I never
denied, but in such cases, whatever is pretended, the commander
or commanders may judge, resist, compel and
punish such transgressors, according to their deserts and
merits. This, if seriously and honestly minded, may, if it
so please the Father of Lights, let in some light to such as
willingly shut not their eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following letter from Mr. Williams to Mr. Winthrop
is chiefly on his common theme, the Indians:</p>

      <div class='line'>“Sir,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Loving respects to you both presented, wishing you a
joyful spring after all your sad and gloomy, sharp and bitter
winter blasts and snows. Sir, one of your friends among
the Narraganset sachems, Mexham, sends this messenger
unto me and prays me to write to you for your help about
a gun, which Kittatteash, Uncas his son, hath lately taken
from this bearer, Ahauansquatuck, out of his house at Pawchauquet.
He will not own any offence he gave him, but
that he is subject to Mexham, though possibly Kittatteash
may allege other causes, yea and true also. I doubt not
of your loving eye on the matter, as God shall please to
give you opportunity. Sir, the last first day divers of Boston
merchants were with me, (about Sergeant Holsey run
from Boston hither, and a woman after him, who lays her
great belly to him.) They tell me, that by a bark come
from Virginia, they are informed of God’s merciful hand in
the safe arrival of Major Sedgwick and that fleet in the
West of England, and that General Penn was not yet gone
out, but riding (all things ready) in Torbay, waiting for
the word; and by letters from good and great friends in
England, I understand there are like to be great agitations
in this country, if that fleet succeed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, a hue and cry came to my hand lately from the Governor
at Boston, after two youths, one run from Captain
Oliver, whom I lighted on and have returned; another from
James Bill, of Boston, who I hear past through our town, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>said he was bound for Pequod. His name is James Pitnie;
he hath on a blackish coat and hat, and a pair of greenish
breeches and green knit stockings. I would now (with
very many thanks) have returned you your Jesuit’s Maxims,
but I was loth to trust them in so wild a hand, nor
some tidings which I have from England. These merchants
tell me, that Blake was gone against the Duke of
Legorne, and had sent for ten frigates more. Sir, the God
of peace fill your soul with that strange kind of peace which
passeth all understanding.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams, being now invested with the office of
President, watched over the interests of the colony with his
usual vigilance and zeal. There was an urgent need of all
his wisdom and firmness. A disposition to abuse the liberty
of conscience, was one of the evils which disturbed the colony.
Mr. William Harris “sent his writings to the main
and to the island, against all earthly powers, parliaments,
laws, charters, magistrates, prisons, punishments, rates, yea,
against all kings and princes, under the notion that the
people should shortly cry out, ‘<em>No lords, no masters</em>,’ and
in open Court protested, before the whole colony Assembly,
that he would maintain his writings with his blood.”<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c010'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The avowal of such sentiments might well alarm the Assembly,
not only for the peace of the colony, but for its
character in the mother country. They accordingly appointed
a committee, says Mr. Backus, “to deal with Mr.
Harris.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Although the several towns were re-united in the government,
yet individuals, who were royalists in principle,
refused to obey it, and created factions. Complaints were
made through Mr. Clarke, to the Protector; but Cromwell
was too busy with concerns at home, to give much attention
to the colonies. He addressed the following letter to
the colony:<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c010'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Your agent here hath represented unto us some particulars
concerning your government, which you judge

great and weighty affairs of the commonwealth, we have

you know, that you were to proceed in your government
according to the tenor of your charter, formerly granted
on that behalf, taking care of the peace and safety of those
plantations, that neither through intestine commotions or
foreign invasions, there do arise any detriment or dishonor
to their commonwealth or yourselves, as far as you by your
care and diligence can prevent. And as for the things that
are before us, they shall, as soon as the other occasions will
permit, receive a just and sufficient determination. And
so we bid you farewell, and rest,</p>

<p class='c016'>“To our trusty and well beloved the President, Assistants
and inhabitants of Rhode-Island, together with Narraganset
Bay, in New-England.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the session of the Assembly, June 28, an act was
passed, founded on the Protector’s letter, in which it was
enacted, that “if any person or persons be found, by the
examination and judgment of the General Court of Commissioners,
to be a ring-leader or ring-leaders of factions or
divisions among us, he or they shall be sent over at his or
their own charges, as prisoners, to receive his or their trial
or sentence, at the pleasure of his Highness, and the Lords
of his Council.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This act proves, that the Assembly, while they recognized
the rights of conscience, were resolved to enforce civil
obedience. It produced the desired effect. Mr. Coddington
soon after signed a public declaration of his submission
to the government of the colony, as now united, and he and
Mr. Dyre subscribed, in the presence of Mr. Williams and
others, an agreement, by which the long-standing feud between
them was amicably settled. Mr. Harris, also, felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the genial influence of the better spirit which now prevailed,
and in the words of Mr. Backus, “cried up government and
magistrates, as much as he had cried them down before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In November, 1655, Mr. Williams wrote the following
letter to the General Court of Massachusetts, in which he
remonstrated, though in a courteous tone, against the disorders
which still continued at Warwick and Pawtuxet, and
which were countenanced, if not fomented, by Massachusetts.
We learn from this letter, and from other sources,
that the inhabitants of Rhode-Island were not allowed to
procure arms and ammunition from Boston, though they
were exposed to attacks from the savages, who were abundantly
supplied from various quarters.<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c010'><sup>[297]</sup></a> Mr. Williams
modestly alludes to his sufferings, when he attempted to
pass through Massachusetts, at his last embarkation for
England. With all these causes of complaint, the mildness
of this letter must be deemed a favorable evidence of a gentle
and pacific temper. The solemn confession, that it
might be better for Rhode-Island to be placed under the
sway of Massachusetts, certainly does honor to his feelings,
whatever may be thought of its wisdom:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“It is my humble and earnest petition unto God and you,
that you may so be pleased to exercise command over your
own spirits, that you may not mind myself nor the English
of these parts (unworthy with myself of your eye) but only
that face of equity (English and Christian) which I humbly
hope may appear in these representations following.</p>

<p class='c016'>“First, may it please you to remember, that concerning
the town of Warwick, (in this colony) there lies a suit of
£2000 damages against you before his Highness and the
Lords of his Council; I doubt not, if you so please, but
that (as Mr. Winslow and myself had well nigh ordered it)
some gentlemen from yourselves and some from Warwick,
deputed, may friendly and easily determine that affair between
you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Secondly, the Indians which pretend your name at
Warwick and Pawtuxet, (and yet live as barbarously, if not
more than any in the country) please you to know their
insolencies upon ourselves and cattle (unto £20 damages
per annum) are insufferable by English spirits; and please
you to give credence, that to all these they pretend your
name, and affirm that they dare not (for offending you) agree
with us, nor come to rules of righteous neighborhood, only
they know you favor us not and therefore send us for redress
unto you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Thirdly, concerning four English families at Pawtuxet,
may it please you to remember that two controversies they
have long (under your name) maintained with us, to a constant
obstructing of all order and authority amongst us.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To our complaint about our lands, they lately have
professed a willingness to arbitrate, but to obey his Highness’
authority in this charter, they say, they dare not for your
sakes, though they live not by your laws, nor bear your
common charges, nor ours, but evade both under color of
your authority.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Honored Sirs, I cordially profess it before the Most
High, that I believe it, if not only they but ourselves and
all the whole country, by joint consent, were subject to your
government, it might be a rich mercy; but as things yet are,
and since it pleased first the Parliament, and then the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Admiral and Committee for Foreign Plantations, and since
the Council of State, and lastly the Lord Protector and his
Council, to continue us as a distinct colony, yea, and since
it hath pleased yourselves, by public letters and references
to us from your public courts, to own the authority of his
Highness amongst us; be pleased to consider how unsuitable
it is for yourselves (if these families at Pawtuxet plead
truth) to be the obstructers of all orderly proceedings amongst
us; for I humbly appeal to your own wisdom and experience,
how unlikely it is for a people to be compelled to
order and common charges, when others in their bosoms,
are by such (seeming) partiality exempted from both.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And, therefore, (lastly) be pleased to know, that there
are (upon the point) but two families which are so obstructive
and destructive to an equal proceeding of civil order
amongst us; for one of these four families, Stephen Arnold,
desires to be uniform with us; a second, Zacharie Rhodes,
being in the way of dipping is (potentially) banished by you.
Only William Arnold and William Carpenter, (very far,
also, in religion, from you, if you knew all) they have some
color, yet in a late conference, they all plead that all the
obstacle is their offending of yourselves.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Fourthly, whereas, (I humbly conceive) with the people
of this colony your commerce is as great as with any in
the country, and our dangers (being a frontier people to the
barbarians) are greater than those of other colonies, and
the ill consequences to yourselves would be not a few nor
small, and to the whole land, were we first massacred or
mastered by them. I pray your equal and favorable reflection
upon that your law, which prohibits us to buy of you
all means of our necessary defence of our lives and families,
(yea in this most bloody and massacreing time.)</p>

<p class='c016'>“We are informed that tickets have rarely been denied
to any English of the country; yea, the barbarians (though
notorious in lies) if they profess subjection, they are furnished;
only ourselves, by former and later denial, seem
to be devoted to the Indian shambles and massacres.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The barbarians all the land over, are filled with artillery
and ammunition from the Dutch, openly and horridly,
and from all the English over the country, (by stealth.) I
know they abound so wonderfully, that their activity and
insolence is grown so high that they daily consult, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>hope, and threaten to render us slaves, as they long since
(and now most horribly) have made the Dutch.</p>

<p class='c016'>“For myself (as through God’s goodness) I have refused
the gain of thousands by such a murderous trade, and think
no law yet extant, amongst yourselves or us, secure enough
against such villany; so am I loth to see so many hundreds
(if not some thousands) in this colony, destroyed like
fools and beasts without resistance. I grieve that so much
blood should cry against yourselves, yea, and I grieve that
(at this instant by these ships) this cry and the premises
should now trouble his Highness and his Council. For the
seasonable preventing of which, is this humble address presented
to your wisdom, by him who desires to be</p>

Lord hath yet created peace, although the sword is yet

wars with France, but only with Spain, and that the prosecution

vigor on both sides intended. This diversion against the
Spaniards hath turned the face and thoughts of many English;
so that the saying of thousands now is, crown the

falls to him, and 10 or 12,000 more than should if his
father had lived but a month longer; but though his father
cast him off, yet he hath not lost in temporals, by being cast
off for God. Our acquaintance, Major Sedgwick, is said to

Your brother Stephen succeeds Major General Harrison.
The Pope endeavors the uniting of all his slaves for his

all flesh is grass, and only the word of the Lord endures

<p class='c009'>The letter of November 15, to the General Court of Massachusetts,
did not produce any favorable change in her
measures. Mr. Williams afterwards wrote to the Governor,
Mr. Endicott, who invited him to visit Boston. The following
address to the General Court was prepared, in which
some of the same topics are again touched:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Copy of a letter from Providence Plantations to the
General Court of the Massachusetts.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Providence, 12, 3, 56, (so called.)</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“May it please this much honored Assembly to remember,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>that, as an officer and in the name of Providence colony,
I presented you with our humble requests before winter,
unto which not receiving answer, I addressed myself this
spring, to your much honored Governor, who was pleased
to advise our sending of some of Providence to your Assembly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Honored Sirs, our first request (in short) was and is,
for your favorable consideration of the long and lamentable
condition of the town of Warwick, which hath been thus:
they are so dangerously and so vexatiously intermingled
with the barbarians, that I have long admired the wonderful
power of God in restraining and preventing very great
fires of mutual slaughters, breaking forth between them.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your wisdoms know the inhuman insultations of these
wild creatures, and you may be pleased, also, to imagine,
that they have not been sparing of your name as the patron
of all their wickedness against our English men, women,
and children, and cattle to the yearly damage of 60, 80 and
100 pounds.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The remedy is (under God) only your pleasure, that
Pumham shall come to an agreement with the town or colony,
and that some convenient way and time be set for
their removal.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And that your wisdom may see just grounds for such
your willingness, be pleased to be informed of a reality of
a solemn covenant between this town of Warwick and
Pumham, unto which, notwithstanding that he pleads his
being drawn to it by the awe of his superior sachems, yet
I humbly offer that what was done, was according to the
law and tenor of the natives, (I take it) in all New-England
and America, viz. that the inferior sachems and subjects
shall plant and remove at the pleasure of the highest
and supreme sachems, and I humbly conceive that it pleaseth
the Most High and Only Wise to make use of such a bond
of authority over them, without which, they could not long
subsist in human society, in this wild condition wherein
they are.</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. Please you not to be insensible of the slippery and
dangerous condition of this their intermingled cohabitation.
I am humbly confident, that all the English towns and
plantations in all New-England, put together, suffer not
such molestation from the natives, as this one town and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>people. It is so great and so oppressive, that I have daily
feared the tidings of some public fire and mischief.</p>

<p class='c016'>“3. Be pleased to review this copy from the Lord Admiral,
and that this English town of Warwick should proceed,
also that if any of yours were there planted, they
should, by your authority, be removed. And we humbly
conceive, that if the English (whose removes are difficult
and chargeable) how much more these wild ones, who remove
with little more trouble and damage than the wild
beasts of the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c016'>“4. Please you to be informed, that this small neck
(wherein they keep and mingle fields with the English) is
a very den of wickedness, where they not only practise the
horrid barbarisms of all kind of whoredoms, idolatries, conjurations,
but living without all exercise of actual authority,
and getting store of liquors (to our grief) there is a confluence
and rendezvous of all the wildest and most licentious natives
and practices of the whole country.</p>

<p class='c016'>“5. Beside satisfaction to Pumham and the former inhabitants
of this neck, there is a competitor who must also
be satisfied; another sachem, one Nawwushawsuck, who
(living with Ousamaquin) lays claim to this place, and are
at daily feud with Pumham (to my knowledge) about the
title and lordship of it. Hostility is daily threatened.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Our second request concerns two or three English
families at Pawtuxet, who, before our charter, subjected
themselves unto your jurisdiction. It is true, there are
many grievances between many of the town of Providence
and them, and these, I humbly conceive, may best be
ordered to be composed by reference.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But (2.) we have formerly made our addresses and now
do, for your prudent removal of this great and long obstruction
to all due order and regular proceedings among us, viz.
the refusal of these families (pretending your name) to
conform with us unto his Highness’ authority amongst us.</p>

<p class='c016'>“3. Your wisdom experimentally knows how apt men are
to stumble at such an exemption from all duties and services,
from all rates and charges, either with yourselves or us.</p>

<p class='c016'>“4. This obstruction is so great and constant, that (without
your prudent removal of it) it is impossible that either
his Highness or yourselves can expect such satisfaction and
observance from us as we desire to render.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“Lastly, as before, we promised satisfaction to the natives
at Warwick, (and shall all possible ways endeavor their
content) so we humbly offer, as to these our countrymen,
First, as to grievances depending, that references may settle
them. Secondly, for the future, the way will be open
for their enjoyment of votes and privileges of choosing or
being chosen, to any office in town or colony.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Our third request is, for your favorable leave to us to
buy of your merchants, four or more barrels of powder
yearly, with some convenient proportion of artillery, considering
our hazardous frontier situation to these barbarians,
who, from their abundant supply of arms from the Dutch,
(and perfidious English, all the land over) are full of our
artillery, which hath rendered them exceedingly insolent,
provoking and threatening, especially the inlanders, which
have their supply from the fort of Aurania. We have been
esteemed by some of you, as your thorny hedge on this side
of you; if so, yet a hedge to be maintained; if as out sentinels,
yet not to be discouraged. And if there be a jealousy of the
ill use of such a favor, please you to be assured that a credible
person in each town shall have the disposal and managing
of such supplies, according to the true intent and purpose.</p>

<p class='c016'>“For the obtaining of these, our just and necessary petitions,
we have no inducement or hope from ourselves, only
we pray you to remember, that the matters prayed, are no
way dishonorable to yourselves, and we humbly conceive,
do greatly promote the honor and pleasure of his Highness,
yea, of the Most High, also; and lastly, such kindnesses
will be obligations on us to study to declare ourselves, upon
all occasions,</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>A few days after, Mr. Williams addressed the following

<p class='c009'>This year is made remarkable by the arrival at Boston,
of several persons, of the new sect called Quakers.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c010'><sup>[298]</sup></a> They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>were imprisoned and banished. The books which they
brought with them were seized and burnt. Severe laws
were enacted to exclude them from the Commonwealth.
In October, 1656, (says Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 181,) “An
act passed, laying a penalty of one hundred pounds upon
the master of any vessel who should bring a known Quaker
into any part of the colony, and requiring him to
give security to carry them back again; that the Quaker
should be immediately sent to the house of correction,
and whipped twenty stripes, and afterwards kept to hard
labor until transportation. They also laid a penalty of
five pounds for importing, and the like for dispersing,
Quaker books, and severe penalties for defending their
heretical opinions. And the next year, an additional law
was made, by which all persons were subjected to the penalty
of forty shillings for every hour’s entertainment given
to any known Quaker; and any Quaker, after the first
conviction, if a man, was to lose one ear, and the second
time the other; a woman, each time to be severely whipped,
and the third time, men or women, to have their tongues
bored through with a red hot iron, and every Quaker, who
should become such in the colony, was subjected to the like
punishments. In May, 1658, a penalty of ten shillings was
laid on every person present at a Quaker meeting, and five
pounds upon every one speaking at such a meeting. Notwithstanding
all this severity, the number of Quakers, as
might well have been expected, increasing rather than diminishing,
in October following, a further law was made for
punishing with death all Quakers, who should return into
the jurisdiction after banishment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this sanguinary law, which passed the Court by a
majority of one vote only, four persons were afterwards executed,
and a large number were imprisoned, whipped,
fined and banished, until an order from the King, Charles
II. in 1661, put an end to these proceedings. The conduct
of some of these persons was scandalous,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c010'><sup>[299]</sup></a> and deserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>punishment, as offences against civil order and decency;
but nothing can justify the severity with which some of
them were treated. The impolicy of persecution was fully
displayed on this occasion; for the Quakers multiplied, in
proportion as they were threatened and punished.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other united colonies passed severe laws against the
Quakers; and they endeavored to prevail on Rhode-Island
to unite in this general persecution. But she remained
true to her principles. The General Assembly, which met
at Portsmouth, March 13, 1657, returned an answer to the
commissioners of the united colonies, in which they held
this language:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whereas freedom of different consciences to be protected
from enforcements, was the principal ground of our
charter, both with respect to our humble suit for it, as also
to the true intent of the honorable and renowned Parliament
of England, in granting of the same to us, which freedom
we still prize, as the greatest happiness that men can possess
in this world, therefore we shall, for the preservation
of our civil peace and order, the more especially take notice
that those people, and any others that are here, or shall
come among us, be impartially required, and to our utmost
constrained, to perform all civil duties requisite. And in
case they refuse it, we resolve to make use of the first opportunity
to inform our agent, residing in England.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The commissioners were not satisfied with this reply,
and the next autumn they wrote again to the Assembly.
An answer was returned, dated October 13, 1657, which,
while it expresses disapprobation of the conduct of some of
the Quakers, unfolds the Rhode-Island doctrine concerning
liberty of conscience, and contains some excellent remarks
on the good effects of toleration in allaying sectarian zeal:</p>

<p class='c009'>“As concerning these Quakers (so called) which are
now among us, we have no law among us whereby to punish
any for only declaring by words, &amp;c. their minds and understandings
concerning the things and ways of God, as to
salvation and an eternal condition. And we find, moreover,
that in those places where these people, aforesaid, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>this colony, are most of all suffered to declare themselves
freely, and are only opposed by arguments in discourse,
there they least of all desire to come; and we are informed,
that they begin to loathe this place, for that they are not
opposed by the civil authority, but with all patience and
meekness are suffered to say over their pretended revelations
and admonitions, nor are they like or able to gain many
here to their way. And surely we find, that they delight
to be persecuted by the civil powers, and when they are so,
they are like to gain more by the conceit of their patient
sufferings, than by consent to their pernicious sayings.”
The letter then expressed a belief, that their doctrines were
dangerous to civil government, and promised, that at the
next General Assembly, the subject should be considered,
and proper measures adopted to prevent any “bad effects
of their doctrines and endeavors.”<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c010'><sup>[300]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This letter was not suited to the prevailing opinions of
that day. The other colonies were incensed by the inflexible
adherence of Rhode-Island to the principles of her
founder. The commissioners again wrote to the General
Assembly, virtually requiring Rhode-Island to unite in a
general persecution, under the penalty of being herself put
under the ban of an excommunication from all commercial
intercourse with the other colonies. This attempt to force
Rhode-Island into measures subversive of her own institutions,
and abhorrent to her feelings, was resisted as resolutely
as were the threats of the British ministry by a subsequent
generation. Rhode-Island adopted the only course
then left to her. She appealed to the government in England,
for protection, while she pursued her settled policy.
The following letter to Mr. Clarke, the agent of the colony
in England, throws much light on her condition and relations
at that time. It was written by a Committee appointed
by the General Assembly, at Warwick, November 5,
1658:<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c010'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-l c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Worthy Sir, and trusty friend, Mr. Clarke,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“We have found, not only your ability and diligence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>but also your love and care to be such concerning the welfare
and prosperity of this colony, since you have been intrusted
with the more public affairs thereof, surpassing the
no small benefit which we had of your presence here at
home, that we in all straits and incumbrances, are emboldened
to repair unto you, for further and continued care,
counsel and help, finding that your solid and christian demeanor
hath gotten no small interest in the hearts of our
superiors, those noble and worthy senators, with whom you
had to do in our behalf, as it hath constantly appeared in
our addresses made unto them; we have by good and comfortable
proofs found, having plentiful experience thereof.
The last year we had laden you with much employment,
which we were then put upon by reason of some too refractory
among ourselves, wherein we appealed unto you for advice,
for the more public manifestation of it, with respect to our
superiors; but our intelligence fell short in that great loss
of the ship, which we concluded here to be cast away.
We have now a new occasion given us by an old spirit,
with respect to the colonies round about us, who seem to
be offended with us, because a sort of people, called by the
name of Quakers, who are come amongst us, who have
raised up divers who at present seem to be of their spirit,
whereat the colonies about us seem to be offended with us,
being the said people have their liberty with us, are entertained
in our houses, or any of our assemblies; and for the
present, we have found no just cause to charge them with
the breach of the civil peace; only they are constantly
going forth amongst them about us, and vex and trouble
them about their religion and spiritual state, though they
return with many a foul scar in their bodies for the same.
And the offence our neighbors take against us, is because
we take not some course against the said people, either to
expel them from amongst us, or take such courses against
them as themselves do, who are in fear lest their religion
should be corrupted by them. Concerning which displeasure
that they seem to take, it was expressed to us in
a solemn letter, written by the commissioners of the united
colonies at their sitting, as though they would either bring
us in to act according to their scantling, or else take some
course to do us a greater displeasure. A copy of which
letter we have herewith sent unto you, wherein you may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>perceive how they express themselves; as also we have
herewith sent our present answer unto them, to give you
what light we may in the matter. There is one clause in
the letter, which plainly implies a threat, though courtly
expressed, as their manner is; which we gather to be this,
that themselves (as we construe it) have been much awed
in point of subjection to the state of England, lest in case
they should decline, England might prohibit all trade with
them, both in point of exportation and importation of any
commodities, which were a host sufficiently prevalent to
subdue New England, not being able to subsist:—even so
they seem to threaten us, by cutting us off from all commerce
and trade with them, and thereby to disable us from
any comfortable subsistence, being that the concourse of
shipping, and all other sorts of commodities, are universally
conversant among themselves: as also knowing that ourselves
are not in a capacity to send out shipping of ourselves,
which in great measure is occasioned <em>by their oppressing
us</em>, as yourself well knows:—as in many other
respects, so in this for one, that we cannot have any thing
from them, for the supply of our necessities, but in effect
they make the price, both of their commodities and our
own. Also, because we have no English coin, but only
that which passeth among these barbarians, and such commodities
as are raised by the labor of our hands, as corn,
cattle, tobacco, &amp;c. to make payment in, which they will
have at their own rates, or else not deal with us; whereby
though they gain extraordinarily by us, yet, for the safeguard
of their religion, they may seem to neglect themselves
in that respect; for <em>what will not men do for their God</em>?
Sir, this is our earnest and pressing request unto you in
this matter, that as you may perceive by our answer unto
the united colonies, we fly as our refuge in all civil respects
to his Highness and honorable Council, as not being subject
to any other in matters of our civil state, so may it
please you to have an eye and ear open, in case our adversaries
should speak, to undermine us in our privileges
granted unto us, and plead our cause in such sort, as that
we may not be compelled to exercise any civil power over
men’s consciences, so long as human orders in point of
civility are not corrupted and violated, which our neighbors
about us do frequently practise, whereof many of us have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>absolute experience, and judge it to be no less than a point
of <span class='fss'>ABSOLUTE CRUELTY</span>.</p>

    </div>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The concluding sentences of this letter are worthy of
special note, as showing, that the rulers of Rhode-Island
carefully distinguished between the rights of conscience
and the duty of obedience to the laws which guard the
civil peace. They permitted no disorderly license, and if
any persons had been guilty, in Rhode-Island, of the acts
which some individuals, calling themselves Quakers, practised
in Massachusetts, they would have been punished.
Mr. Williams, in his subsequent controversy with George
Fox, expressed his approbation of the punishment of certain
females in Massachusetts, for their shameless conduct, affirming
it to be a perversion of terms to call the punishment
of such actions, persecution.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must now return to Mr. Williams. He held the
office of President two years. On the 1st of February,
1657–8, he issued a warrant against Mr. William Harris,
for the alleged crime of opposing the Protector’s government.
The warrant ordered his arrest and imprisonment,
for the purpose of sending him to England, in accordance,
probably, with the act of June, 1655. How far this strong
measure was deserved by the conduct of Mr. Harris, we
cannot now determine.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c010'><sup>[302]</sup></a> It has been inferred that it was
not sustained by public opinion, because, at the next election,
Mr. Williams was superseded, as President, by Mr.
Benedict Arnold. It is not improbable, that he was urged
too far, by zeal to uphold the charter and the Protector’s
authority, and perhaps by personal hostility towards Mr.
Harris, between whom and himself there was, for many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>years, a very acrimonious feud.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c010'><sup>[303]</sup></a> There is, however, no
very conclusive evidence, that Mr. Williams’ conduct, in
this case, was generally disapproved. He occupied a seat
in the General Assembly, at intervals, for several years, both
as an assistant, and as a representative from Providence.
He was often chosen on important committees, and he
continued, till his death, to serve the public, in various
ways, with ability and patriotic zeal.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c010'><sup>[304]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Death of Cromwell—his character—Richard Cromwell succeeds—Restoration
of Charles II.—Act of Uniformity, and ejection of the
Non-conformists—Affairs in Rhode-Island—Indian deed—letters
to Mr. Winthrop.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Protector Cromwell died in September, 1658. This
wonderful man raised himself, from a private station, to the
supreme power, and fulfilled his high functions with an
ability and energy, which few occupants of a throne have
ever displayed. He has shared the usual fate of those men,
whose conduct and principles have placed them apart from
the mass of mankind. No other man was ever in a
position, which exposed him to the hatred and misrepresentation
of so many parties. The royalists heaped on
him unmeasured obloquy as a usurper. The High Church
party denounced him as a foe to the hierarchy. The Presbyterians
disliked and opposed him, as a friend of toleration.
The ultra-republicans reproached him for his ambition,
because he did not think England, in her existing condition,
to be capable of a free republican government, and
therefore retained in his hands the power which he believed
to be indispensable to the peace of the state. The irreligious,
of all parties, scoffed at him as a hypocrite and a
fanatic, though the charge is somewhat inconsistent with
itself.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c010'><sup>[305]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>That Cromwell had faults, may be freely acknowledged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>by his warmest friends. That his course was always wise
and justifiable, cannot be maintained; but it may be doubted,
whether, if the circumstances of that stormy and critical
period in which he lived were fairly weighed, and his
character and conduct were sifted, with a candid spirit, it
would not be found, that Cromwell deserves more of the
applause of the friends of liberty and religion, than of their
censures. It is certain, that his accusers yield to him the
praise of qualities, which it is difficult to reconcile with the
crimes that they impute to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is surprising to hear, from American writers, reproaches
against Cromwell as a “usurper.”<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c010'><sup>[306]</sup></a> This language is not
strange from the lips of a royalist, or a High Church partisan,
in England; but from an American, it is inconsistent,
and unworthy of his position as a citizen of a great and
free country, where public opinion ought to be decisively
and steadily in favor of republican principles, and ought thus
to form an august tribunal, whose verdict should be felt and
respected throughout the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>An American, surely, can feel no respect for hereditary
titles. In his view, Cromwell would have had a clear right to
the throne, if the people had chosen to give him the
crown; and there is quite as much evidence, that the
great body of the people of England were satisfied with
the government of Cromwell, as that they were content
with that of Charles II. If by usurpation is meant a violation
of the Constitution, it may be replied, that the Constitution
was already broken. The King had trampled on it,
and the Long Parliament had governed the kingdom for
years with an entire disregard of the Constitution. The
country was in a state of anarchy, and it was a blessing to
England that Cromwell seized the reins, and controlled
the fierce parties who convulsed the nation. Napoleon,
though his subsequent course was unjustifiable, did a
good service to France, when he overthrew the detestable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>demagogues who had deluged her with blood. If our peerless
Washington had found this country, in 1784, in the
condition in which England was in 1653, and France in
1800, it would have been his duty, as a patriot and a philanthropist,
to employ the power at his control for the preservation
of order, and the restoration of public happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is certain, that the great ends of government,—peace
and prosperity at home and respect abroad,—were enjoyed
under Cromwell’s sway, to a far higher degree than they
were under most of the British monarchs, preceding the
revolution. Even Hume, who was an infidel and a tory,
and of course hated Cromwell, acknowledges, that the distracted
state of England, and the mutual rancor of its
various factions, rendered an energetic government indispensable,
and would have furnished a reasonable excuse
for what he calls the “temporary usurpation” of Cromwell,
if the Protector had been guilty of no other crime.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c010'><sup>[307]</sup></a> The
excellent Baxter, who carried his loyalty to the preposterous
length of opposing Cromwell, under whom he enjoyed
perfect toleration, and striving to restore the “legitimate”
King, with the almost certain prospect of being persecuted
and silenced, confesses, that religion flourished, under the
Protector, in a degree before unknown. “I do not believe,”
he says,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c010'><sup>[308]</sup></a> “that ever England had so able and faithful
a ministry since it was a nation, as it hath at this day;
and I fear, that few nations on earth, if any, have the like.
Sure I am, the change is so great, within these twelve
years, that it is one of the greatest joys that ever I had in
the world to behold it. O how many congregations are
now plainly and frequently taught, that lived then in great
obscurity. How many able, faithful men are there now
in a county, in comparison of what were then.” And yet
Baxter labored and prayed for the restoration of Charles,
under whom Baxter himself and two thousand more of
these faithful ministers were speedily silenced.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cromwell has been accused of hypocrisy, but this charge,
especially when made by such men as Hume, is unworthy
of credit. Baxter, who was a good judge of piety, does not
accuse Cromwell of hypocrisy, but acknowledges that he
was a pious man, though misled by ambition. “Both piety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>and ambition,” he says, “concurred in countenancing all
whom he thought godly, of what sect soever. Piety pleaded
for them as godly, and charity as men, and ambition
secretly told him what use he might make of them. He
meant well in all this at the beginning, and thought he did
all for the safety of the godly, and the public good, but not
without an eye to himself.”<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c010'><sup>[309]</sup></a> As to his ambition, he probably
had a sufficient share of it; but he refused the crown
when it was urged on him, with many plausible arguments,
by Parliament, and when, as Hume intimates, a large part
of the nation would have acquiesced. His personal and
domestic habits are acknowledged, by all parties, to have
been pure and amiable. His court was perhaps the most
moral and decorous, that England has ever seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Protector was a friend of toleration, and this single
trait in his character is sufficient to entitle his memory to
respect. He was not entirely consistent, it is true, but no
public man, at that day, except Roger Williams, was so.
Cromwell was surrounded with difficulties; and the “Instrument
of Government,” under which he held the Protectorship,
excluded Episcopalians and Catholics from the enjoyment
of that religious liberty which it granted to all
others.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c010'><sup>[310]</sup></a> But the spirit of the Protector was more tolerant
than the laws, and he often connived at the meetings of the
Episcopalians. A man, who, at that time, and in his post,
could act, so far as he did, on the principle of an equitable
toleration of all religious opinions, could not have been either
a fanatic or a despot.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c010'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Roger Williams was a friend of Cromwell. It has been
supposed, that he was allied to him by birth. He was certainly
drawn to him by a communion of spirit, on the subject
of religious liberty. In his letters, he repeatedly alludes
to familiar conversations with Cromwell. The friendship
of Milton and Roger Williams may be viewed as an honorable
testimony to the character of the Protector. It is
difficult to believe, that these men would have yielded their
confidence and esteem to a hypocrite, either in religion or
in politics. It is not more easy to believe, that such a man
as Cromwell has been described, would have admitted men
so sagacious and upright as Milton and Williams, to a close
scrutiny of his actions, or that by all the cunning which
has been ascribed to him he could have deceived them.</p>

<p class='c009'>These three men, in fact, resembled each other, in their
character, in their opinions, and in the treatment which
they received. Each was misunderstood; each has suffered
obloquy, and each is receiving, from the calm and
enlightened judgment of the present age, that just sentence,
which, sooner or later, will reward him, who aims to advance
the happiness of men, and who perseveres, through
evil and good report, in upholding the persecuted cause of
truth and freedom.<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c010'><sup>[312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Cromwell was quietly succeeded, as Protector, by his
son Richard, a proof, that the nation were not very much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>dissatisfied with Cromwell’s sway. But Richard possessed
neither the talents, nor the ambition of his father.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c010'><sup>[313]</sup></a> The
aspiring and factious men whom Oliver held in check, soon
forced his son to retire from his burthensome and difficult
office. A stormy period succeeded, during which the
rival parties struggled for victory. At length, General
Monk, obtaining the command of a powerful army, restored
the King, Charles II. who entered London in triumph, May
29, 1660. The nation received him with apparent joy,
being weary of the disorders which preceded and followed
the energetic government of Cromwell. The royalists,
among whom were the Episcopalians, welcomed the King
with delight. The Presbyterians, who had disliked Cromwell,
were also zealous in restoring Charles, with the expectation
that their system would be continued as the national
religion. They were so eager to merit the gratitude
of the King, that they exacted of him no conditions, but
were satisfied with the assurance, that he would grant
liberty to all <em>tender consciences</em>; a promise, which he afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>found it very easy to violate, by insisting, that
all consciences which did not agree with his views, were
not tender, but criminally obstinate. The efforts of the
Presbyterians to obtain a compromise with the Episcopalians,
by which they might be comprehended in the
Established Church, failed.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c010'><sup>[314]</sup></a> The bishops would not
consent to any alterations of the liturgy. The Presbyterians
would not listen to the King’s proposition of toleration
to other denominations, by which he meant to favor
the Papists, but which the Presbyterians rejected, more
from a dread of Popery, we may hope, than from their general
aversion to toleration. The Act of Uniformity was
passed, and took effect, August 24, 1662. Two thousand
of the best ministers in England were ejected from their
livings, because they could not submit to the rigorous requirements
of the act. Dreadful distress to them and to
their families was the natural consequence. The interests
of religion suffered incalculable injury, by the loss of these
ministers, and by the character of many of their successors.</p>

<p class='c009'>King Charles II. was proclaimed in Rhode-Island, October
19, 1660. A new commission was sent to Mr.
Clarke, and he continued his exertions to procure a new
charter for the colony. Various sums of money were voted,
at different times, to be sent to Mr. Clarke.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c010'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>At Providence, there seems to have been a spirit among
some of the inhabitants, which disturbed the peace of Mr.
Williams. Whether they were envious of his influence,
or impatient under the restraints which he steadily advocated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>with the whole weight of his authority, does not now
appear. But it is certain, that parties were formed, which,
for many years, greatly interrupted the tranquillity of the
town; and it was thought necessary, in 1669, to send a
Committee of the General Assembly, to settle the difficulties.
The boundaries of the town were a fruitful cause of contention,
and involved the inhabitants in disputes, which
were not adjusted till long after the death of Mr. Williams
and of most of his contemporaries. He complains, in a letter,
dated July, 1669, that they had “four sorts of bounds at
least.” He says: “some (that never did this town nor colony
good, and it is feared never will) cried out, when Roger
Williams had laid himself down as a stone in the dust for
after comers to step on in town and colony, <em>Who is Roger
Williams?</em> We know the Indians and the sachems as
well as he. We will trust Roger Williams no longer. We
will have our bounds confirmed us under the sachems’
hands before us.”<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c010'><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In August, 1659, the following deed was procured from
the Narraganset sachems:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Deed of Scattape and Quoquagunewett, son of Mexham,
son of Qunnouone, called by the English Canonicus,
uncle to Miantinomo, who made a league of peace with
the English in the Massachusetts, for all the Indians in
these parts, in the time of the Pequod war with the English,
this our grandfather and cousin, these sachems, granted
to Roger Williams, agent for the men of Providence and
the men of Pawtuxet, a tract of land, reaching from Pawtucket
river to Pawtuxet river. All the lands between the
streams of those rivers, and up these streams without limits,
for their use of cattle, did they grant to the men aforesaid,
the men of Providence and the men of Pawtuxet:—to
whom we establish the lands aforesaid, up the streams
of those rivers, and confirm, without limit, or as far as the
men abovesaid, of Providence and of Pawtuxet, shall judge
convenient for their use of cattle, as feeding, ploughing,
planting all manner of plantations whatsoever; we say, all
the lands, according to the limits abovesaid, we establish
and confirm to the men of Providence and the men of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>Pawtuxet, according to their joint agreement, in the most
absolute tenure of fee simple, to them, their heirs and assigns
forever. And hereby bind ourselves, our heirs and
assigns, not to molest or trouble the men abovesaid, in the
full enjoyment of the land abovesaid. Nevertheless, it
shall not be lawful for the men abovesaid to remove the
Indians that are up in the country, from their fields, without
the Indians’ content and consent; nor shall it be lawful
for any of those Indians to sell any of the lands abovesaid
to any, only it shall be lawful for them to take of the
men of Providence and the men of Pawtuxet, according
to their joint agreements, satisfaction for their removing.
And, as we have established to the men abovesaid the land
and deed granted by our grandfather and cousin, so do we
now, also, confirm the grant of confirmation by our cousin,
Cursackquanth, Caufanequanutte, and Kenerselath.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Richard Smith, and Richard Smith, jun. swore, that
this deed was explained before it was signed.” April 28,
1660, Acaquaomitt, son of Quoquagunewett, confirmed
the preceding deed.</p>

<p class='c009'>This deed was, it appears, written by Mr. William Harris.
This fact accounts for its phraseology. It was asserted
by Mr. Williams and others, that the sachems did
not understand its full import, when they signed it.
It was procured on the ground, that Mr. Williams’
deed from the sachems conveyed a life estate only to him,
and consequently his deed to the purchasers could convey
no other title. This deed, also, greatly extended the original
bounds, and thus gratified those who had contended,
that the phrase “up streams without limits,” in the
sachems’ deed to Mr. Williams, gave a title to the lands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>lying along the rivers Pawtuxet and Pawtucket, up to
their sources. This construction was always resisted by
Roger Williams, as false, and as injurious to the natives.
The new deed was disapproved by himself and others.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c010'><sup>[317]</sup></a>
It appears to have been procured in no friendly spirit towards
himself. It implied that he had acted improperly,
in taking the deed in his own name, and it calls him the
“agent of the men of Providence and the men of Pawtuxet.”
But it has, we trust, been satisfactorily shown, in
preceding pages, that Mr. Williams was the rightful proprietor
of the original grant, and was under no obligation
to divide the land among his fellow-colonists.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following letters to Mr. Winthrop, touch on several
interesting topics:</p>

<p class='c016'>“To my honored, kind friend, Mr. John Winthrop, Governor,
at Hartford, on Connecticut.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>

      <div class='line'>“Sir,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Loving respects to yourself and Mrs. Winthrop, &amp;c.
Your loving lines in this cold, dead season, were as a cup
of your Connecticut cider, which we are glad to hear
abounds with you, or of that western metheglin, which you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>and I have drunk at Bristol together, &amp;c. Indeed, it is
the wonderful power and goodness of God, that we are
preserved in our dispersions among these wild, barbarous
wretches. I hear not of their excursions this winter, and
should rejoice if, as you hint, Uncas and his brother were
removed to Long-Island, or any where, or else, as I have
sometimes motioned, a truce for some good term of years
might be obtained amongst them. But how should we expect
that the streams of blood should stop among the dregs
of mankind, when the bloody issues flow so fresh and fearfully
among the finest and most refined sons of men and
sons of God. We have not only heard of the four northern
nations, Dania, Swedia, Anglia, and Belgium, all Protestants,
(heretics and dogs, with the Pope, &amp;c.) last year
tearing and devouring one another, in the narrow straits
and eminent high passages and turns of the sea and
world; but we also have a sound of the Presbyterians’
rage new burst out into flames of war from Scotland, and
the independent and sectarian army provoked again to new
appeals to God, and engagements against them. Thus,
while this last Pope hath plied with sails and oars, and
brought all his popish sons to peace, except Portugal, and
brought in his grand engineers, the Jesuits, again to Venice,
after their long just banishment, we Protestants
are wofully disposed to row backward, and bring our sails
aback-stays, and provoke the holy, jealous Lord, who is a
consuming fire, to kindle again those fires from Rome and
hell, which formerly consumed (in Protestant countries)
so many precious servants of God. The late renowned
Oliver confessed to me, in close discourse about the Protestants’
affairs, &amp;c. that he yet feared great persecutions to
the Protestants from the Romanists, before the downfall of
the Papacy. The histories of our fathers before us, tell us
what huge bowls of the blood of the saints that great whore
hath been drunk with, in (now) Protestant dominions.
Sure her judgment will ring through the world, and it is
hoped it is not far from the door. Sir, you were, not long
since, the son of two noble fathers, Mr. John Winthrop
and Mr. H. Peters. It is said they are both extinguished.
Surely, I did ever, from my soul, honor and love them
even when their judgments led them to afflict me. Ye
the Father of Spirits spares us breath, and I rejoice, Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>that your name (amongst the New-England magistrates
printed, to the Parliament and army, by H. Nort. Rous,
&amp;c.) is not blurred, but rather honored, for your prudent
and moderate hand in the late Quakers’ trials amongst us.
And it is said, that in the late Parliament, yourself were
one of the three in nomination for General Governor over
New-England, which however that design ripened not, yet
your name keeps up a high esteem, &amp;c. I have seen your
hand to a letter to this colony, as to your late purchase of
some land at Narraganset.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c010'><sup>[318]</sup></a> The sight of your hand hath
quieted some jealousies amongst us, that the Bay, by this
purchase, designed some prejudice to the liberty of conscience
amongst us. We are in consultations how to answer
that letter, and my endeavor shall be, with God’s help,
to welcome, with both our hands and arms, your interest
in these parts, though we have no hope to enjoy your personal
residence amongst us. I rejoice to hear that you
gain, by new plantations, upon this wilderness. I fear that
many precious souls will be glad to hide their heads, shortly,
in these parts. Your candle and mine draws towards
its end. The Lord graciously help us to shine in light and
love universally, to all that fear his name, without that monopoly
of the affection to such of our own persuasion only;
for the common enemy, the Romish wolf, is very high in
resolution, and hope, and advantage to make a prey on all,
of all sorts, that desire to fear God. Divers of our neighbors
thankfully re-salute you. We have buried, this winter,
Mr. Olney’s son, whom, formerly, you heard to be afflicted
with a lethargy. He lay two or three days wholly senseless,
until his last groans. My youngest son, Joseph, was
troubled with a spice of an epilepsy. We used some remedies,
but it hath pleased God, by his taking of tobacco,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>perfectly, as we hope, to cure him. Good Mr. Parker, of
Boston, passing from Prudence Island, at his coming on
shore, on Seekonk land, trod awry upon a stone or stick,
and fell down, and broke the small bone of his leg. He
hath lain by of it all this winter, and the last week was
carried to Boston in a horse litter. Some fears there were
of a gangrene. But, Sir, I use too much boldness and prolixity.
I shall now only subscribe myself,</p>

<p class='c016'>“A sudden warning gives me but time of this abrupt
salutation to your kind self and Mrs. Winthrop, wishing
you peace. I promised to a neighbor, a former servant of
your father’s, (Joshua Windsor,) to write a line, on his behalf,
and at his desire, unto you. His prayer to you is,
that when you travel toward Boston, you would please to
come by Providence, and spare one hour to heal an old
sore,—a controversy between him and most of his neighbors,
in which, I am apt to think, he hath suffered some
wrong. He hath promised to submit to your sentence.
His opposite, one James Ashton, being desired by me to
nominate also, he resolves also to submit to your sentence,
which will concern more will and stomach than damage;
for the matter only concerns a few poles of ground, wherein
Joshua hath cried out of wrong these many years. I hope,
Sir, the blessed Lord will make you a blessed instrument
of chiding the winds and seas; and I shall rejoice in your
presence amongst us. There are greater ulcers in my
thoughts at present, which, I fear, are incurable, and that
it hath pleased the Most Wise and Most High to pass an
irrevocable sentence of amputations and cauterizations
upon the poor Protestant party. The clouds gather mighty
fast and thick upon our heads from all the Popish quarters.
It hath pleased the Lord to glad the Romish conclave with
the departure of those two mighty bulwarks of the Protestants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Oliver and Gustavus; to unite, (I think by this time)
all the Catholic kings and princes, for Portugal was like,
very like, of late, to return to the yoke of Spain, whose
treasure from the Indies it hath pleased God to send home,
so wonderfully great and rich this year, that I cannot but
fear the Lord hath some mighty work to effect with it.
We know the Catholic King was in debt, but he now overflows
with millions, which God is most like to expend
against the Protestants or the Turks, the two great enemies,
(the sword-fish and the thrasher) against the Popish leviathan.
The Presbyterian party in England and Scotland is
yet very likely to make some struggle against the Popish
invasions; and yet in the end I fear (as long I have feared,
and long since told Oliver, to which he much inclined,)
the bloody whore is not yet drunk enough with the blood
of the saints and witnesses of Jesus. One cordial is,
(amongst so many the merciful Lord hath provided) that
that whore will shortly appear so extremely loathsome, in
her drunkenness, bestialities, &amp;c. that her bewitched paramours
will tear her flesh, and burn her with fire unquenchable.
Here is a sound that Fairfax, and about two hundred
of the House with him, differ with the King. The
merciful Lord fit us to hear and feel more. It is a very
thick and dreadful mist and swamp, with which the Lord
hath a great while suffered us to labor in, as hoping to
wade out, break through, and escape shipwreck. In
Richard Protector’s Parliament, they fell into three factions
presently: royalists, protectorians, (which were
most Presbyterian, and earned it,) and commonwealth’s
men. The Presbyterians, when General Monk brought in
the secluded members, carried it again, of late, clearly,
and so vigorously against the Papists, that stricter laws
than ever. There must surely, then, be great flames, before
the King can accomplish his engagements to the Popish
party.</p>

But the storm increaseth, and trying with our mainsails and
mizzens will not do. We must, therefore, humbly beg
patience from the Father of Lights and God of all mercies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>to lay at Hull, in hope. It was a motto in one of the late

and must be, but the Lord will be glorious, in plucking up
whatever his holy hand hath not planted. My brother runs
strongly to Origen’s notion of universal mercy at last,
against an eternal sentence. Our times will call upon us
for thorough discussions. The fire is like to try us. It is a
wonderful mercy the barbarians are yet so quiet. A portion
of our neighbors are just now come home, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">re infecta</span></i>. The

<p class='c014'>Infant baptism—half-way covenant—laws to support religion—charter
from Charles II.—first meeting of Assembly—Mr. Clarke—difficulties
about boundaries—charges against Rhode-Island, concerning
Catholics and Quakers.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be useful to look, for a moment, at the difficulties
which arose, about this time, in the other colonies, respecting
infant baptism. This rite had been hitherto administered
to those children, whose immediate parents were
both members of a church. But as the country increased,
many persons, who were not members of a church, had
children, for whom, nevertheless, they desired baptism.
The question accordingly arose, whether the children of
such parents could properly be admitted to baptism. It
was, on the one hand, a departure from the principle, that
as faith is required in the Scriptures as a prerequisite to
baptism, and as the infant could not exercise faith, it must
consequently be baptized on the ground of its parents’
faith. It seemed hard, on the other hand, that if there was
any virtue in infant baptism, the innocent child should be
deprived of it, because its parents were not pious. The
question began to be publicly agitated. The magistrates
of Connecticut, about the year 1656, sent several queries
on the subject to the magistrates of Massachusetts.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c010'><sup>[319]</sup></a> A
meeting of ministers was held in Boston, June 4, 1657, at
which the “half-way covenant,” as it was called, was
adopted. “It provided, that all persons of sober life and
correct sentiments, without being examined as to a change
of heart, might profess religion, or become members of the
church, and have their children baptized, though they did
not come to the Lord’s table.”<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c010'><sup>[320]</sup></a> This disastrous departure
from the Scriptures, and from the former practice of the
churches, was not unanimously adopted. Many ministers
and churches were opposed to it. A synod was held, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Boston, in September, 1662, including all the ministers in
Massachusetts. This body ratified the decision of the
council of 1657. But parties were immediately formed,
for and against the synod. The Rev. Charles Chauncey,
President of Harvard College, and the Rev. Increase Mather,
wrote against the decision, while others wrote on the
opposite side. The country was thrown into a ferment.
A division took place in the First Church in Boston, and
the Old South Church was formed in May, 1669, by a minority
of the First Church, the majority of whose members
opposed the decision of the synod, while the seceding
minority approved it. The General Court took up the
subject, and at its session, in May, 1670, pronounced the
formation of the new church to be irreligious, illegal and
disorderly. But public opinion set in favor of the half-way
covenant. At the next election, the members who
had opposed the new church were left out, and others, of
different opinions, elected. The Court then passed a vote
in favor of the new church, and the cause of innovation
and corruption of the purity of the churches triumphed.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c010'><sup>[321]</sup></a>
This result generally ensues, when questions pertaining to
religion are decided at the polls.</p>

<p class='c009'>The half-way covenant was, at first, opposed by many
churches, but it afterwards extensively prevailed, and
“wherever,” says Dr. Hawes, “it did prevail, the consequences
were eminently unhappy. Great numbers came
forward to own the covenant, as it was called, and had their
children baptized; but very few joined the church, in full
communion, or partook of the sacrament. Satisfied with
being half-way in the church, and enjoying a part of its
privileges, they settled down in a state of dull and heartless
formality, and felt little or no concern respecting their
present condition, or future prospects.”<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c010'><sup>[322]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>But all men were not content to be half-way in the
church. About the year 1700, Mr. Stoddard, a distinguished
minister of Northampton, came to the conclusion,
that the Lord’s Supper is a converting ordinance, and that
all persons ought to come to this ordinance. Thus all the
barriers which separate the church from the world were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>thrown down, and the consequences were deplorable.
Multitudes of unconverted persons rushed into the churches,
anxious for the privileges of church members, for political
purposes. The church at Northampton is a signal instance
of the effects of the system. The great President
Edwards, after he had been pastor for several years, endeavored
to introduce the old practice of discipline, and to
require piety as a qualification for membership. But the
worldly feeling in his parish was too strong, and notwithstanding
his colossal reputation, and his faithful and successful
labors, he was expelled from his pastoral office, in
a most ungrateful and unkind manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may mention, here, another cause of injury to the
purity and permanent prosperity of the churches. The
support of the ministry, by taxes, levied on all the inhabitants,
operated oppressively on the members of other denominations,
created much distress to individuals, and produced
a wide-spread dissatisfaction in the community. As
the right of a voice in the election of a minister was justly
claimed by those who were obliged to pay taxes for his
support, the character of the minister depended, of course,
on that of a majority of the voters in a parish. The consequence
has been, that in many instances, when the majority
have become opposed to the doctrines of the existing
church, the minister has been expelled, another of opposite
sentiments has been chosen, the meeting-house has been
seized, and funds, contributed by pious men of former
generations, for the support of the ministry, have been applied
to the maintenance of men to whom those contributors
would have refused to listen. This is the natural
effect of the system, and those who uphold it have no right
to complain. The American principle, that representation
accompanies taxation, is just. If men are taxed by law to
support a minister, they have a right to a voice in his
election, and they will, of course, choose a minister whose
principles accord, as nearly as possible, with their own.
Reflecting and pious men, generally, are now, it is believed,
thoroughly convinced, that the principles of Roger
Williams furnish the only secure basis for the peace and
prosperity of a church. It is hoped that the laws of Massachusetts
will, ere long, be conformed to these principles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>and religion be committed to the protection of God and of
the liberal and pure-hearted disciples of the Redeemer.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c010'><sup>[323]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This subject has detained us from our main theme,
though it is appropriate to a work which we design to be
an exposition of the nature and effects both of the principles
of religious liberty and of the opposite doctrines.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Clarke continued his faithful labors in England, and
on the 8th of July, 1663, he obtained from Charles II. a
charter, which continues, till the present day, to be the
fundamental law of the State.<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c010'><sup>[324]</sup></a> It commits the government
of the colony to a Governor, Deputy Governor, and
ten Assistants, to be elected annually, and a House of
Deputies, consisting of six from Newport, four from each
of the towns of Providence, Portsmouth and Warwick, and
two from each of the other towns. It defines the boundaries
of the colony, about which disputes existed for many
years. It contains this most important provision, in
which the principles on which the colony was founded
are embodied: “No person within the said colony, at
any time hereafter, shall be any wise molested, punished,
disquieted, or called in question, for any differences in
opinion, in matters of religion, who do not actually disturb
the civil peace of our said colony; but that all and every
person and persons may, from time to time, and at all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>times hereafter, freely and fully have and enjoy his own
and their judgments and consciences, in matters of religious
concernments, throughout the tract of land hereafter
mentioned, they behaving themselves peaceably and quietly,
and not using this liberty to licentiousness and profaneness,
nor to the civil injury or outward disturbance of
others.”<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c010'><sup>[325]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This noble declaration is in accordance with the address
of the petitioners to his Majesty, in which they
“freely declared, that it is much on their hearts (if they
be permitted) to hold forth a lively experiment, that a most
flourishing civil state may stand, and best be maintained, and
that among, our English subjects, with a full liberty in religious
concernments; and that true piety, rightly grounded
upon Gospel principles, will give the best and greatest
security to sovereignty, and will lay in the hearts of men
the strongest obligations to true loyalty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This charter was received with great joy. It was
brought from Boston, by Capt. George Baxter, and was read
publicly at Newport, November 24, 1663. The records
say, that “the said letters, with his Majesty’s royal stamp,
and the broad seal, with much beseeming gravity, were
held up on high, and presented to the perfect view of the
people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thanks were voted to the King, to the Earl of Clarendon,
and to Mr. Clarke, together with a resolution to pay
all his expenses, and to present him with a hundred pounds.
Thanks were also voted to Capt. Baxter, with a present of
thirty pounds, besides his expenses from Boston.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c010'><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The first Assembly under the new charter was held
March 1, 1663–4. Mr. Benedict Arnold was created by
the charter the first Governor, and among the Assistants
was Mr. Williams.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Assembly now assumed a peremptory tone towards
the disturbers of the public peace at Pawtuxet and Warwick,
and towards intruders at Narraganset.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Mr. Williams was appointed to transcribe the charter.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c010'><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>At the session, in May, 1664, Mr. Williams was again
an Assistant. At this session, the seal of the colony was
fixed, an anchor, with the word Hope over it, and the
words Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams was this year appointed one of a committee
to review the laws, and one of another committee to
fix the eastern line of the state.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this session, a committee was appointed to audit Mr.
Clarke’s accounts. The sum of £343 15<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>, was found
to be due to him. Mr. Clarke returned from England, in
June, 1664, after an absence, in the service of the colony,
of twelve years. He was afterwards elected Deputy Governor
three years successively. He was an able and good
man, whom the State of Rhode-Island ought to remember
with respect and gratitude, as one of her chief benefactors.
He died April 20, 1676. The money due to him from the
colony was never paid, during his life, though the Assembly
frequently urged the towns to pay it, and Mr. Williams
used his influence to accomplish this act of public justice.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c010'><sup>[328]</sup></a>
Mr. Clarke, in his will, left a considerable estate, to be appropriated
to “the relief of the poor, or bringing up children
unto learning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>An account of the difficulties with Massachusetts, Connecticut
and Plymouth, respecting boundaries, belongs
rather to a history of Rhode-Island, than to this work.
They continued for several years. Commissioners were appointed
by the King, in 1664, to settle the disputes respecting
the Narraganset country, which was claimed by Connecticut,
and by individuals, who had purchased lands there.
But the matter was not settled for many years. The boundaries
fixed by the charter were at length ascertained and
acknowledged.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c010'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Two topics deserve notice here, because they affect the
character of Roger Williams, and of Rhode-Island. We
allude to the charges, that in 1663–4, Roman Catholics
were excluded from the rights of citizens, and that in 1665,
oppressive laws were enacted against the Quakers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first of these charges is made by Chalmers,<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c010'><sup>[330]</sup></a> whose
situation, as chief clerk in the Plantation Office, in England,
gave him access to original documents. He asserts,
that at the meeting of the General Assembly, March 1,
1663–4, it was enacted, “that no freeman shall be imprisoned,
or deprived of his freehold, or condemned, but by
the judgment of his peers, or the law of the colony; that
no tax shall be imposed or required of the colonists, but by
the act of the General Assembly; that all men [professing
Christianity] of competent estates, and of civil conversation,
who acknowledge and are obedient to the civil magistrates,
though of different judgments in religious affairs, [Roman
Catholics only excepted] shall be admitted freemen, or
may choose, or be chosen, colonial officers.”<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c010'><sup>[331]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Such an act would, indeed, have been an anomaly in the
legislation of Rhode-Island, and it has been alleged as an
evidence of inconsistency in Roger Williams and the colony.
The subject has, therefore, been examined with great
care. The Hon. Samuel Eddy, for many years the Secretary
of State in Rhode-Island, declares:<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c010'><sup>[332]</sup></a> “I have formerly
examined the records of the State, from its first settlement,
with a view to historical information, and lately from 1663
to 1719, with a particular view to this law excluding Roman
Catholics from the privileges of freemen, and can find nothing
that has any reference to it, nor any thing that gives
any preference or privileges to men of one set of religious
opinions over those of another, until the revision of 1745.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This testimony might, alone, be sufficient to disprove
the allegation, though it is possible, that such an act might
be passed, and not be recorded. But it is not probable,
and when the uniform policy of the colony from the beginning,
and other circumstances, are considered, it becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>morally certain, that no such act ever received the sanction
of the Legislature of Rhode-Island.</p>

<p class='c009'>That entire liberty was professed and maintained,
from the commencement of the colony, is certain. It was
one of the fundamental regulations in the respective towns,
and when they were united, under the first charter, it was
expressly enacted, that, while the civil laws should be
obeyed, “all men may walk as their consciences persuade
them, every one in the name of his God.”<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c010'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The second charter declared, that “no person within the
said colony, at any time hereafter, shall be anywise molested,
punished or disquieted, or called in question, for any
differences in opinion, in matters of religion, and do not
actually disturb the civil peace of our said colony.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is utterly incredible, that the Assembly, while they
were passing votes of thanks to the King for the charter,
would enact a law in violation of his positive declaration in
the instrument itself, and at variance with their previous
policy and with all their institutions. An exclusion of
Catholics, moreover, would not only have violated the
charter, and thus offended the King, but the legislators of
Rhode-Island had sufficient knowledge of Charles, to be
aware, that nothing would be less acceptable to him than
a law against the Catholics, for whom he endeavored to
obtain toleration in England.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be added, that there were no Catholics in Rhode-Island,
so late as 1695, according to Cotton Mather.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c010'><sup>[334]</sup></a> Mr.
Eddy well remarks: “Why a law should be made to exclude
from the privileges of freemen, those who were not
inhabitants, by those who believed all to be equally entitled
to their religious opinions, is difficult to conceive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the next session, in May, 1664, the Assembly enacted,
that, “at present this General Assembly judgeth it their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>duty to signify his Majesty’s gracious pleasure vouchsafed
in these words to us, verbatim, (viz.)”—quoting the declaration
from the charter which is cited above.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the session in May, 1665, in answer to certain propositions
of the King’s Commissioners, in which the King
requires, that all the citizens shall enjoy equal civil and
religious rights, without regard to their opinions, the Assembly
say: “This Assembly do, with all gladness of
heart, and humbleness of mind, acknowledge the great
goodness of God and favor of his Majesty in that respect,
declaring, that as it hath been a principle set forth and
maintained in this colony, <em>from the very beginning thereof</em>,
so it is much on their hearts to preserve the same liberty
to all persons within this colony forever, as to the worship
of God therein, taking care for the preservation of the civil
government, to the doing of justice and preserving each
other’s privileges from wrong and violence to others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Eddy accounts for the existence of the spurious
words in the copy of the laws from which Mr. Chalmers
quoted, by supposing, that they were inserted, without authority,
at some period subsequent to 1719, by a revising
committee, who might be desirous to please the government
in England. Mr. Eddy says, in conclusion: “Thus you
have positive and indubitable evidence, that the law excluding
Roman Catholics from the privileges of freemen was
not passed in 1663–4, but that they were by law, at this
time, and long after, entitled to all the privileges of other
citizens; and satisfactory evidence that these privileges
were continued by law until 1719, when, or in one of the
subsequent revisions, the words <em>professing Christianity</em>,
and <em>Roman Catholics only excepted</em>, were inserted by the
revising committee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If, however, such an act had been passed, it would not
necessarily impeach the character of Mr. Williams. He
was an Assistant, only, in the Legislature of 1663–4, and
could not be responsible for its acts. His own principles
are on record. He contended for liberty of conscience
to all men without any restriction. In his “Hireling
Ministry none of Christ’s,” printed in 1652—only eleven
years before—he says: “All these consciences, (yea, the
very conscience of Papists, Jews, &amp;c. as I have proved at
large in my answer to Mr. Cotton’s washings) ought freely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>and impartially to be permitted their several respective
worships, their ministers of worships, and what way of
maintaining them they please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We proceed, now, to the other charge. It is contained
in an article, in 1 His. Col. v. pp. 216–220, signed Francis
Brinley, whose statement is repeated in Holmes’ American
Annals, vol. i. p. 341. Mr. Brinley says: “1665. The
government and council of Rhode-Island, &amp;c. passed an order
for outlawing the people called Quakers, because they
would not bear arms, and to seize their estates; but the
people in general rose up against these severe orders, and
would not suffer it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We are again indebted to Mr. Eddy for the means of
correcting a mistake. He says (2 His. Col. vii. p. 97,) that
the account of Mr. Brinley “is incorrect and partial.”
There was a difficulty, in which the Quakers, it seems,
felt themselves aggrieved, but it was not the result of any
acts aimed directly at them. The origin of it, as Mr. Eddy
thinks, was this: The commissioners of the King required,
in his name, “that all householders, inhabiting this colony,
take the oath of allegiance.” The Assembly, in reply,
stated, that it had been the uniform practice of the colony,
in pursuance of their great principles of religious liberty,
to allow those who objected to take an oath, to make an engagement,
under the penalty for false swearing. An engagement
was accordingly drawn up, in which the individual
promised to bear true allegiance to the King and his
successors, and to yield “due obedience unto the laws
established from time to time.” The Quakers, it appears,
objected to this part of the engagement, because it bound
them to pay obedience to the militia laws. The Assembly
had enacted, that those who did not take the engagement,
should not be permitted to “vote for public officers or deputies,
or enjoy any privilege of freemen.” Those persons,
consequently, who refused to take the engagement, were
disfranchised; and to this effect, Mr. Brinley probably alludes,
when he says that the Quakers were outlawed. If
so, his statement is very loose and injurious, for it implies,
that the act was expressly directed against them.
But there was no design, apparently, on the part of the
Assembly to affect them. The King commanded the General
Assembly to require an oath of allegiance. They dispensed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>with the oath, but required an engagement, promising,
in general terms, obedience to the laws. It would
seem, that all the citizens might have safely taken the engagement,
reserving their opposition to particular laws, to
which they might be conscientiously opposed. An engagement
to obey the laws would, of course, mean such laws
only as were consistent with the laws of God and with the
rights of conscience. The Assembly cannot, at any rate,
be justly charged with an assault on the Quakers. The
engagement was mitigated, the very next year, to suit their
views, and every disposition was manifested to consult their
feelings and respect their rights. One of their number
was, the next year, elected Deputy Governor.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Williams’ public services—religious habits—efforts as a minister—Indians—private
affairs—letter to John Whipple.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are now approaching the close of Mr. Williams’ life.
Years were increasing upon him, and abating the vigor of
his body and the ardor of his mind. Yet we find his name
in the records both of the town and colony, so frequently,
as to prove, that he retained his zeal for the public welfare,
and that he enjoyed, to the end of his life, a large
measure of public confidence. In the town meetings, he
was often appointed moderator. He was appointed as a
member of numerous committees, and was usually selected,
when a skilful pen was needed for the public service.</p>

<p class='c009'>After serving the colony for two years, as President, and
repeatedly as Assistant, or Commissioner, under the first
charter, he occupied a seat in the General Assembly, under
the new charter, as an Assistant, in the years 1664, 1670,
and 1671. He was chosen, in 1677, but he refused to
serve, on account, probably, of his age. He was a Deputy
from Providence, in May, 1667.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of his religious habits we have little knowledge. We
have satisfactory reasons, however, for believing, that he
preserved the character of an upright Christian. His
books and letters are distinguished by the language of
piety, and his general conduct exhibited its influence.
Even Cotton Mather confesses, that “in many things he
acquitted himself so laudably, that many judicious persons
judged him to have had the root of the matter in him, during
the long winter of this retirement.”<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c010'><sup>[335]</sup></a> He had, it is true,
no connection with any church; a circumstance, which
we must regret, because it injured his reputation and his
usefulness, while it diminished his personal enjoyment and
spiritual growth. But we know that his reason for this
course was, an erroneous idea, that the true church was, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>a time, lost. He did not undervalue the benefits of church
fellowship, but ardently longed for the restoration of the
church. In his reply to George Fox, written about 1672,
he says, (p. 66,) “After all my search, and examinations,
and considerations, I said, I do profess to believe,
that some come nearer to the first primitive churches, and
the institutions and appointments of Christ, than others;
as in many respects, so in that gallant, and heavenly, and
fundamental principle, of the true matter of a Christian
congregation, flock or society, viz. actual believers, true
disciples and converts, living stones, such as can give
some account how the grace of God hath appeared unto
them, and wrought that change in them. I professed, that
if my soul could find rest, in joining unto any of the
churches professing Christ Jesus now extant, I would
readily and gladly do it, yea unto themselves, whom I now
opposed.”<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c010'><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>As a minister of the Gospel, we have evidence that he
did not wholly discontinue his labors; though he must,
according to his principles, have confined himself to
“prophecy,” or a declaration of truth and witness against
error. Mr. Callender says, (p. 57,) “Mr. Williams used
to uphold a public worship, sometimes, though not weekly,
as many now alive [1738] remember, and he used to go
once a month, for many years, to Mr. Smith’s, in the Narraganset,
for the same end.” If persons alive in 1738,
were present at Mr. Williams’ meetings, as Mr. Callender’s
expression seems to imply, those meetings must have been
held towards the close of his life. His visits to Narraganset
were designed, it has been supposed, for the benefit of
the Indians; but this is doubtful. There is reason to believe,
that his object was to instruct the whites, who either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>lived in that neighborhood, far from any Christian
teacher, or who were occasionally at Mr. Smith’s trading-house.<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c010'><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>He did, however, endeavor to instruct the Indians.
“He made,” says Mr. Callender, (p. 84) “some laudable
attempts to instruct them, yet he was much discouraged,
not only by want of a lawful warrant, or an immediate
commission to be an apostle to them, but especially by (as
he thought) the insuperable difficulty of preaching Christianity
to them in their own language, with any propriety,
without inspiration.” On this subject, he speaks, in his
“Bloody Tenet more Bloody.” He says, that he and others
have found “how hard it is for any man to attain a little
propriety of their language in common things, (so as to
escape derision among them) in many years, without
abundant of conversing with them, in eating, travelling and
lodging with them.” He refers, for proof, to the case of
Mr. Eliot, who, notwithstanding his intimacy with the
Indians, could not always make himself understood.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c010'><sup>[338]</sup></a> Mr.
Williams seemed to think, that when the ministry should
be restored, the gift of tongues would be bestowed on missionaries,
to qualify them for their work.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>The Narraganset Indians were strongly opposed to the
Gospel. It is said, that they allowed Mr. Williams to
preach to them, but would permit no one else. They
loved him, but they rejected his doctrines. His Key and
his letters prove, nevertheless, that his benevolent efforts
were not entirely in vain, and authorize the hope, that at
the last day, he may share, with Eliot, Mayhew and Brainerd,
the blessing of ransomed souls from among the unhappy
native tribes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of Mr. Williams’ private affairs, we know little. Notices
respecting lands occasionally appear on the records
of the town.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c010'><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>His public spirit, and disposition to serve his fellow-citizens,
appear on various occasions. In 1666, a vote of
the town was passed, “remitting to him an engagement
made by him to the town, for clapboards and nails for the
building of a town house.” The inference is, that the
project which he, perhaps, devised, and offered to promote,
failed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following letter to the town, relates to a bridge. On
the first Monday of June, 1662, the town had ordered a
bridge to be built over Moshassuck river, “by Thomas
Olney his house,” to be done before the next hay-time.
It would seem, that this order was not accomplished,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>and that the following letter refers to the same
project:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>

<p class='c016'>“Unto this day, it pleased the town to adjourn for the
answering of the bill for the bridge and others. I have
conferred with Shadrach Manton and Nathaniel Waterman,
about their proposal, and their result is, that they
cannot obtain such a number as will join with them, to
undertake the bridge upon the hopes of meadow. I am,
therefore, bold, after so many anchors come home, and so
much trouble and long debates and deliberations, to offer,
that if you please, I will, with God’s help, take this bridge
unto my care, by that moderate toll of strangers of all sorts,
which hath been mentioned; will maintain it so long as it

that have less use, half a day.</p>

<p class='c016'>“3. I shall join with any of the town, more or few,

<p class='c009'>It does not appear, whether the bridge was built, at this
time, or not. In February, 1711–12, Mr. Daniel Abbot
was sent as an agent to Massachusetts and Connecticut, to
solicit aid in building “three great bridges, upon the road
leading from Connecticut toward Boston, viz. one at Pawtuxet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Falls, one at Weybosset in Providence,<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c010'><sup>[340]</sup></a> and the

<p class='c016'>“I humbly offer to consideration my long and constant
experience, since it pleased God to bring me unto these

<p class='c016'>“First, that all the Nipmucks were, unquestionably,
subject to the Narraganset sachems, and, in a special manner
to Mexham, the son of Canonicus, and late husband to
this old squaw sachem, now only surviving. I have abundant
and daily proof of it, as plain and clear as that the
inhabitants of Newbury or Ipswich, &amp;c. are subject to the

<p class='c016'>“2. I was called by his Majesty’s Commissioners to testify
in a like case between Philip and the Plymouth Indians,
on the one party, and the Narragansets on the
other, and it pleased the committee to declare, that the
King had not given them any commission to alter the Indians’
laws and customs, which they observed amongst
themselves: most of which, although they are, like themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>barbarous, yet in the case of their mournings, they
are more, humane, and it seems to be more inhumane in
those that professed subjection to this the very last year,
under some kind of feigned protection of the English, to
be singing and dancing, drinking, &amp;c. while the rest were
lamenting their sachems’ deaths.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I abhor most of their customs; I know they are barbarous.
I respect not one party more than the other, but

</div>

<p class='c016'>“I kindly thank you, that you so far have regarded my
lines as to return me your thoughts, whether sweet or sour I
desire not to mind. I humbly hope, that as you shall
never find me self-conceited nor self-seeking, so, as to
others, not pragmatical and a busy-body as you insinuate.
My study is to be swift to hear, and slow to speak, and I
could tell you of five or six grounds (it may be more) why
I give this my testimony against this unrighteous and monstrous
proceeding of Christian brethren helping to hale one
another before the world, whose song was lately and
loudly sung in my ears, viz. the world would be quiet
enough, were it not for these holy brethren, their divisions
and contentions. The last night, Shadrach Manton told
me that I had spoken bad words of Gregory Dexter (though
Shadrach deals more ingenuously than yourself saying the
same thing, for he tells me wherein,) viz. that I said he
makes a fool of his conscience. I told him I said so, and
I think to our neighbor Dexter himself; for I believe he
might as well be moderator or general deputy or general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>assistant, as go so far as he goes, in many particulars; but
what if I or my conscience be a fool, yet it is commendable
and admirable in him, that being a man of education,
and of a noble calling, and versed in militaries, that his
conscience forced him to be such a child in his own house,
when W. Har. strained for the rate (which I approve of) with
such imperious insulting over his conscience, which all conscientious
men will abhor to hear of. However, I commend
that man, whether Jew, or Turk, or Papist, or whoever, that
steers no otherwise than his conscience dares, till his conscience
tells him that God gives him a greater latitude. For,
neighbor, you shall find it rare to meet with men of conscience,
men that for fear and love of God dare not lie, nor
be drunk, nor be contentious, nor steal, nor be covetous,
nor voluptuous, nor ambitious, nor lazy-bodies, nor
busy-bodies, nor dare displease God by omitting either
service or suffering, though of reproach, imprisonment,
banishment and death, because of the fear and love of
God.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If W. Wickenden received a beast of W. Field, for
ground of the same hold, I knew it not, and so spake the
truth, as I understood it. 2. Though I have not spoke
with him, yet I hear it was not of that hold or tenure, for
we have had four sorts of bounds at least.</p>

<p class='c016'>“First, the grant of as large accommodations as any
English in New-England had. This the sachems always
promised me, and they had cause, for I was as a right hand
unto them, to my great cost and travail. Hence I was
sure of the Toceheunguanit meadows, and what could with
any show of reason have been desired; but some, (that never
did this town nor colony good, and, it is feared, never will,)
cried out, when Roger Williams had laid himself down as
a stone in the dust, for after-comers to step on in town and
colony, ‘Who is Roger Williams? We know the Indians
and the sachems as well as he. We will trust Roger Williams
no longer. We will have our bounds confirmed us
under the sachems’ hands before us.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. Hence arose, to my soul cutting and grief, the
second sort of bounds, viz. the bounds set under the hands
of those great sachems Canonicus and Miantinomo, and
were set so short (as to Mashapaug and Pawtucket, and at
that time,) because they would not intrench upon the Indians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>inhabiting round about us, for the prevention of strife
between us.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The third sort of bounds were of favor and grace, invented,
as I think, and prosecuted by that noble spirit,
now with God, Chad Brown. Presuming upon the sachems’
grant to me, they exceeded the letter of the sachems’ deed,
so far as reasonably they judged, and this with promise of
satisfaction to any native who should reasonably desire it.
In this third sort of bounds, lay this piece of meadow
hard by Captain Fenner’s ground, which, with two hogs,
William Wickenden gave to W. Field for a small beast,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Beside these three sort of bounds, there arose a fourth,
like the fourth beast in Daniel, exceeding dreadful and
terrible, unto which the Spirit of God gave no name nor
bounds, nor can we in the first rise of ours, only boundless
bounds, or a monstrous beast, above all other beasts or
monsters. Now, as from this fourth wild beast in Daniel,
in the greater world, have arisen all the storms and tempests,
factions and divisions, in our little world amongst us,
and what the tearing consequences yet will be, is only
known to the Most Holy and Only Wise.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You conclude with your innocence and patience under
my clamorous tongue, but I pray you not to forget that
there are two basins. David had one, Pilate another.
David washed his hands in innocence, and so did Pilate,
and so do all parties, all the world over. As to innocence,
my former paper saith something. As to patience,
how can you say you are patient under my clamorous
tongue, when that very speech is most impatient and unchristian?
My clamor and crying shall be to God and
men (I hope without revenge or wrath) but for a little
ease, and that yourselves, and they that scorn and hate me
most, may, if the Eternal please, find cooling in that hot,
eternal day that is near approaching. This shall be the

<p class='c009'>This letter is interesting for several reasons. The reference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>to Mr. Dexter’s refusal to pay his taxes, from conscientious
scruples, shows, that Mr. Williams accurately discriminated
between the rights of conscience, and a perversion
of those rights. It is worthy of notice, too, that Mr.
Williams condemned the conduct of Mr. Dexter, though
an intimate friend; and approved, in part, at least, that of
Mr. Harris, though a bitter hostility existed between them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Controversy with the Quakers—Philip’s war—letters—Mr. Williams’
death.</p>

<p class='c008'>We will now give a brief account of Mr. Williams’ controversy
with the Quakers. It was an unhappy strife, in
which all parties displayed more zeal than Christian meekness
or charity. It was especially unfortunate for Mr.
Williams, for it plunged him, in his old age, into a dispute,
in which he could not hope to effect much good, and which
was certain to draw upon him much odium.</p>

<p class='c009'>His motives, however, ought to be clearly understood.
The colony of Rhode-Island had incurred reproach among
the other colonies, because she refused to join in a persecution
of the Quakers. Rhode-Island was the refuge of
these persons, some of the magistrates, at this time, were
of that sect, and it was asserted, that the public feeling in
Rhode-Island was friendly to their doctrines and practices.
Mr. Williams declares, in his book on the controversy, that
he was induced to engage in a dispute with them, in order
to bear public testimony, that while he was decidedly opposed
to any measures which tended to impair liberty of
conscience, he nevertheless disapproved the principles of
the Quakers.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c010'><sup>[342]</sup></a> He says, that when he met them at Newport,
on the first day of the dispute, “I took my seat at the
other end of the house opposite to them, and began telling
them, that the Most High was my witness, that not out of
any prejudice against, or disrespect to, the persons of the
Quakers, many of whom I knew and did love and honor,
nor any foolish passion of pride or boldness, for I desired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>to be sensible of my many decays of my house of clay, and
other ways; nor any earthly or worldly ends I had, that
occasioned this trouble to myself and them.” p. 26.</p>

<p class='c009'>Candor must admit, that his motives were laudable—a
zeal for the honor of the colony, and for what he believed
to be the truth. He accordingly took occasion, when the
celebrated George Fox<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c010'><sup>[343]</sup></a> was in Rhode-Island, to propose a
public discussion, at Newport and Providence, in which
the principles of the Quakers should be examined, in a
friendly debate.</p>

<p class='c009'>The challenge was in these words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“To George Fox, or any other of my countrymen at
Newport, who say they are the apostles and messengers of
Christ Jesus. In humble confidence of the help of the
Most High, I offer to maintain, in public, against all comers,
these fourteen propositions following, to wit: the first seven
at Newport, and the other seven at Providence. For the
time when, I refer it to George Fox and his friends, at
Newport.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such public debates were not uncommon during the reformation,
in Germany, and in later times, in England.
They have been held, in our own days, but their effect has
seldom been beneficial to the cause of truth. They are
more adapted to irritate than to convince. Few men have
sufficient self-command to preserve their temper, in a controversy
conducted through the press. When brought into
personal contact, before a large assembly, the meekest men
could scarcely avoid being chafed and petulant. Such
contests are like the battles of old times, when the spear
or the sword was the chief weapon, and the combatants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>being brought hand to hand, fought with embittered rancor
and dreadful carnage. Modern battles, in which the
parties are at a greater distance, are less sanguinary. The
result of these disputes, moreover, is as uncertain a test of
truth and justice, as the termination of the ancient appeals
to personal combat. Stronger lungs and greater self-conceit
have sometimes enabled the advocate of error to win the
victory.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fourteen propositions of Mr. Williams we shall not
quote. They affirmed, that the principles of the Quakers
were unscriptural and pernicious.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams sent these propositions to Newport, but
George Fox left the town for England, without seeing
them. Mr. Williams asserted, that Fox departed in order
to avoid the debate, and he condescended to a pun on
“George Fox’s <em>slily</em> departing.” This insinuation was unfounded
and unjustifiable. Fox unceremoniously charged
him with lying, but this gross accusation cannot be admitted.
Mr. Williams undoubtedly thought his assertion
true,<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c010'><sup>[344]</sup></a> though he ought not to have made it without better
authority.</p>

<p class='c009'>The debate commenced, however, at Newport, on the
9th of August, 1672. Mr. Williams rowed, in a boat, to
Newport, thirty miles, a feat which few men of seventy-three
years could perform, in these degenerate days. He
arrived at Newport about midnight.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c010'><sup>[345]</sup></a> The next day the debate
commenced, in the Quaker meeting-house. John
Stubs, John Burnyeat and William Edmundson were the
champions opposed to him. He speaks of the two former
as able and learned men. The debate continued three
days. It was, according to his account, a very disorderly
scene. There was no moderator, and Mr. Williams complains
of frequent and rude interruptions. His health was
feeble, and he says, that, on the morning of the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>day, “I heartily wished that I might rather have kept my
bed, than have gone forth to a whole day’s fresh disputes.”
His brother, Robert Williams, then a schoolmaster in
Newport, attempted to aid him, but his interference was
not permitted by his opponents. Mr. Williams’ demeanor,
during the controversy, was, apparently, patient and collected.
The debate was renewed at Providence on the
17th, and continued one day, when it was terminated,
without producing any change of opinion on either side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams wrote an account of this dispute, in a large
book, of 327 pages. It was entitled, “George Fox digged
out of his Burrowes,” &amp;c., in allusion to a book which
Fox and his friend Edward Burrowes (or Burrough) had
written. Of Mr. Williams’ book we shall give a further
account. It is able and acute, but it is disfigured by much
severe language.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fox and Burnyeat wrote a reply, entitled, “A New-England
Firebrand Quenched,” in which they railed at
Mr. Williams, in a coarse and bitter style.<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c010'><sup>[346]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The following letter of Mr. Williams alludes to the publication
of his book against Fox:<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c010'><sup>[347]</sup></a></p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>your little, yet great remembrance of the hand of
the Lord to yourself and your son, late departed. I praise

to read your heavenly desires and endeavors, that your
trials may be gain to your own souls, and the souls of the
youth of the place, and all of us. You are not unwilling,
I judge, that I deal plainly and friendly with you. After
all that I have seen and read and compared about the seventh
day, (and I have earnestly and carefully read and
weighed all I could come at in God’s holy presence) I cannot
be removed from Calvin’s mind, and indeed Paul’s
mind, Col. ii. that all those sabbaths of seven days were
figures, types and shadows, and forerunners of the Son of
God, and that the change is made from the remembrance
of the first creation, and that (figurative) rest on the seventh
day, to the remembrance of the second creation on
the first, on which our Lord arose conqueror from the
dead. Accordingly, I have read many, but see no satisfying
answer to those three Scriptures, chiefly Acts 20, 1
Cor. 16, Rev. 1, in conscience to which I make some poor
conscience to God as to the rest day. As for thoughts for
England, I humbly hope the Lord hath hewed me to write
a large narrative of all those four days’ agitation between
the Quakers and myself; if it please God I cannot get it
printed in New-England, I have great thoughts and purposes
for old. My age, lameness, and many other weaknesses,
and the dreadful hand of God at sea, calls for deep
consideration. What God may please to bring forth in the

<p class='c009'>The calamitous and decisive war with Philip claims our
notice. This chief, whose Indian name was Metacom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>but who received the name of Philip from the English, was
the second son of Massassoit, the principal sachem of the
Pokanokets. Philip succeeded his brother Alexander, who
died in 1662, in consequence, it has been supposed, of his
shame and resentment for what he thought an insult from
the whites. Philip was an able and ambitious chief. He
saw the increasing power of the colonists, and clearly perceived,
that the utter extinction of the Indians would be
the result, unless the progress of the whites could be arrested.
It is said, however, that he was averse to commencing
hostilities, being aware that the colonists were too
powerful to be successfully resisted;<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c010'><sup>[348]</sup></a> but he was forced
into the war by the ardor of his young warriors. All the
Indian tribes remained quiet, with the exception of a few
hostile indications, for nearly forty years after the destruction
of the Pequods.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rumors of intended war on the part of Philip were circulated
in 1671. The Governor of Plymouth, and several
other gentlemen from Plymouth and Massachusetts, invited
Philip to meet them at Taunton; but he refused to come,
till, it is said,<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c010'><sup>[349]</sup></a> Mr. Williams and Mr. Brown, of Swansea,
were employed as mediators. Mr. Williams’ agency was,
as usual, successful, and Philip met the Governor, disclaimed
all hostile designs, promised future fidelity, and
surrendered about seventy guns, as a proof of his sincerity.
The war was thus delayed four years.</p>

<p class='c009'>The interval was, it appears, employed by Philip in
making preparations for war. He endeavored to concert
a general league among the Indians in New-England, and
it is said, that most of the tribes entered into his plans.
The Narragansets, especially, who still nourished a desire
of vengeance for the treacherous murder, as they viewed
it, of their sachem, Miantinomo, engaged to aid Philip,
with a force of four thousand warriors, in the spring of
1676.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c010'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>But, for some cause, hostilities commenced before the
time appointed. Philip is supposed to have been urged to
begin the war, by the death of John Sassamon, an Indian,
who had served Philip as a secretary. He communicated
to the English the designs of Philip, and he was soon after
found murdered. Three Indians, who were believed to be
his murderers, were tried and executed, at Plymouth, in
June, 1675. Philip, who was thought to be implicated in
the murder, immediately commenced hostilities, by attacking
the town of Swansea, on the 24th of June. The war,
being commenced, was prosecuted with great fury, many
towns were burnt, and many of the inhabitants killed. It
was a mercy to the whites, that the Indians had not fully
matured their plans and begun the contest in concert.
The Narragansets renewed their league with the colonists,<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c010'><sup>[351]</sup></a>
though they afterwards joined in the war against them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following letter of Mr. Williams to Governor Leverett,
of Massachusetts, is very interesting and characteristic:</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>and drilling and seeming flights, into such places as
are full of long grass, flags, sedge, &amp;c. and then inviron
them round with fire, smoke and bullets. Some say no
wise soldier will so be caught; but as I told the young
prince, on his return lately from you, all their war is commootin;
they have commootined our houses, our cattle, our
heads, &amp;c., and that not by their artillery, but our weapons;
that yet they were so cowardly, that they have not taken
one poor fort from us in all the country, nor won, nor
scarce fought, one battle since the beginning. I told him
and his men, being then in my canoe, with his men with
him, that Philip was his cawkakinnamuck, that is, looking
glass. He was deaf to all advice, and now was overset,
Cooshkowwawy, and catcht at every part of the country to
save himself, but he shall never get ashore, &amp;c. He
answered me in a consenting, considering kind of way,
Philip Cooshkowwawy: I went with my great canoe to
help him over from Seekonk (for to Providence no Indian
comes) to Pawtuxet side. I told him I would not ask him
news, for I knew matters were private; only I told him that
if he were false to his engagements, we would pursue them
with a winter’s war, when they should not, as musketoes
and rattlesnakes in warm weather, bite us, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I carried him and Mr. Smith a glass of wine, but
Mr. Smith not coming, I gave wine and glass to himself,
and a bushel of apples to his men, and being therewith
(as beasts are) caught, they gave me leave to say any
thing, acknowledged loudly your great kindness in Boston,
and mine, and yet Capt. Fenner told me yesterday, that he
thinks they will prove our worst enemies at last. I am

<p class='c016'>“To Mrs. Leverett, and other honored and beloved

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I hope your men fire all the woods before them, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I pray not a line to me, except on necessary business;

boldness to visit yourself, as I have occasion. I would not

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>The war occasioned great alarm and distress. It spread
over New-England, and threatened, for a while, the destruction
of the colonies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many of the inhabitants of Providence and of other
towns removed to Newport, for safety; but a considerable
number remained, among whom was Mr. Williams, though
it seems his wife and family removed to the island.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c010'><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams was very active, notwithstanding his age.
He accepted a military commission, and the title, “Captain
Roger Williams,” appears on the records. It certainly
displayed spirit and patriotism in a man of seventy-seven
years, to buckle on his armor for the defence of his home
and his fellow-citizens. He sent the following proposition
to the town: “I pray the town, in the sense of the late
bloody practices of the natives, to give leave to so many as
can agree with William Field, to bestow some charge upon
fortifying his house, for security to women and children.
Also to give me leave, and so many as shall agree, to put
up some defence on the hill, between the mill and the
highway, for the like safety of the women and children in
that part of the town.” This proposal was signed by eleven
persons, who subscribed various sums, to defray the expense.
The highest subscription was two pounds, six shillings,
except that of Mr. Williams, which was ten pounds,
though we may presume that he was not the richest man
among them.</p>

<p class='c009'>A garrison was established at Providence, by the General
Assembly, with seven men, under the command of
Captain Arthur Fenner, with a provision, however, that it
should “not eclipse Captain Williams’ power in the exercise
of the train bands there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The town was attacked by the Indians, on the 29th of
March, 1676, and twenty-nine houses were burnt, among
which was that, in which the records of the town were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>kept. These were thrown into the mill-pond, and afterwards
recovered, though much injured.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is said, that when the Indians approached Providence,
Mr. Williams took his staff, and went to meet them on the
heights north of the cove. He remonstrated with the
sachems, and warned them of the power and vengeance of
the English. “Massachusetts,” said he, “can raise thousands
of men at this moment, and if you kill them, the King
of England will supply their place as fast as they fall.”
“Well,” answered one of the chieftains, “let them come.
We are ready for them. But as for you, brother Williams,
you are a good man. You have been kind to us many
years. Not a hair of your head shall be touched.”<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c010'><sup>[353]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>We cannot narrate the incidents of this dreadful war.
The Indians suffered a severe defeat, December 19, 1675,
at the capture of their fort, situated in a swamp in the
present town of South-Kingstown. In the battle, about a
thousand of the Indians are supposed to have been killed,
and about two hundred of the whites, including six captains.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip was finally killed, August 12, 1676, near Mount
Hope, by an Indian, under the command of Col. Church.
The war now closed. It decided the fate of the New-England
Indians. The Pokanokets were nearly exterminated.
The Narragansets never recovered from the blow.
Thousands of the natives were killed, and many who were
made prisoners, were sent out of the country and sold as
slaves.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the victory was dearly bought by the colonists.
Their whole disposable force was put in requisition. Thirteen
towns were entirely destroyed by the Indians; six
hundred dwelling-houses were burnt, and about the same
number of the colonists, including twelve captains, were
killed, so that almost every family lost a relative. The
destruction of property, and the cost of the war, were immense.
The disbursements of the colonies were estimated
at one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c010'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The terror and distress which this war produced may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>explain, if they cannot justify, many acts of the whites.
The body of Philip was treated with an indignity, which
dishonored his captors. His head was sent to Plymouth,
where it was exposed on a gibbet, and his hand was
sent to Boston. His little son was taken prisoner, and
several of the divines were of opinion, that he ought to
be put to death, on the strength of Jewish precedents;
but he was spared, only to be sold as a slave in Bermuda.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Providence, the following occurrence took place, in
August, after the death of Philip:</p>

<p class='c009'>“August 25. One Chuff, an Indian, so called in time
of peace, because of his surliness against the English, could
scarcely come in, being wounded some few days before, by
Providence men. His wounds were corrupted and stank,
and because he had been a ring-leader all the war to most
of the mischiefs to our houses and cattle, and what English
he could, the inhabitants of the town cried out for justice
against him, threatening themselves to kill him, if the authority
did not. For which reason the Captain Roger Williams
caused the drum to be beat, the town council and
council of war to be called. All called for justice and execution.
The council of war gave sentence, and he was
shot to death, to the great satisfaction of the town.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At a town meeting, August 14, 1676, a list was made of
persons “who stayed and went not away,” and to these
persons, it was judged, certain Indians, who were captives,
ought to be delivered as slaves, or servants, for a term of
years. A committee was appointed on the subject, who
presented the following report:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>“<em>Report of the Committee on sale of Indians.</em></div>

<p class='c009'>We cannot, at this day, determine, fairly, the question,
how far the sale of the Indian captives was necessary or
just. It is, however, painful to our feelings; and we cannot
but be surprised and sorry, to see the name of Roger
Williams connected with such a transaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>In May, 1677, Mr. Williams was elected an Assistant,
but he declined, on account, probably, of his age. About
this time, he wrote thus to the town of Providence: “I pray
the town, that the place of meeting be certain, and some
course settled for payment; that the clerk and sergeant be
satisfied, according to moderation, that the town business
may go on cheerfully; that the business of the rate (paid
by so many already) be finished; that the old custom of
order be kept in our meetings, and those unruly be reproved,
or upon obstinacy, cast out from sober and free
men’s company; that our ancient use of arbitration be
brought into esteem again; that (it being constantly reported,
that Connecticut is upon the gaining of his Majesty’s
consent to <em>enslave us to their parish worship</em>) we consider
what we ought to do.”<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c010'><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In October, 1677, commissioners from the several colonies
met at Providence, to settle the long contested disputes
between Mr. Harris and others about lands. Mr. Harris
laid before the Court a long statement, in which he preferred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>heavy charges against Mr. Williams, and the latter
made counter statements, in a similar style. The result of
the examination was favorable to the claims of Mr. Harris
and his friends, who obtained five verdicts from a jury.
But the disputes were not settled, till more than thirty years
afterwards.<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c010'><sup>[356]</sup></a> Our limits do not allow us to enter into particulars,
which could not be detailed without a tedious and
unprofitable prolixity. They properly belong to a history
of the State.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the few last years of Mr. Williams’ life, we have
scanty notices. The following letter<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c010'><sup>[357]</sup></a> contains a reference
to his age and health, and is a specimen of his constant
zeal to serve his friends:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Roger Williams, of Providence, in the Narraganset
Bay, in New-England, being (by God’s mercy) the first
beginner of the mother town of Providence, and of the colony
of Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations, being
now near to fourscore years of age, yet (by God’s mercy)
of sound understanding and memory; do humbly and faithfully
declare, that Mr. Richard Smith, senior, who for his
conscience to God left fair possessions in Glocestershire,
and adventured, with his relations and estate, to New-England,
and was a most acceptable inhabitant, and a prime
leading man in Taunton and Plymouth colony; for his
conscience sake, many differences arising, he left Taunton
and came to the Narraganset country, where, (by God’s
mercy and the favor of the Narraganset sachems) he broke
the ice at his great charge and hazard, and put up in the
thickest of the barbarians, the first English house amongst
them. 2. I humbly testify, that about forty years from this
date, he kept possession, coming and going himself, children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>and servants, and he had quiet possession of his housing,
lands and meadow; and there, in his own house, with much
serenity of soul and comfort, he yielded up his spirit to
God, (the Father of spirits) in peace. 3. I do humbly and
faithfully testify as abovesaid, that since his departure, his
honored son, Capt. Richard Smith, hath kept possession,
(with much acceptance with English and pagans) of his
father’s housing, lands and meadows, with great improvement
also by his great cost and industry. And in the late
bloody Pagan war, I knowingly testify and declare, that it
pleased the Most High to make use of himself in person,
his housing, goods, corn, provisions and cattle, for a garrison
and supply for the whole army of New-England, under
the command of the ever to be honored General Winslow,
for the service of his Majesty’s honor and country of New-England.
4. I do also humbly declare, that the said Capt.
Richard Smith, junior, ought, by all the rules of equity,
justice and gratitude, (to his honored father and himself)
to be fairly treated with, considered, recruited, honored,
and, by his Majesty’s authority, confirmed and established
in a peaceful possession of his father’s and his own possessions
in this pagan wilderness, and Narraganset country.
The premises I humbly testify, as now leaving this country

<p class='c009'>The following note was directed to Mr. Daniel Abbott,
the town clerk of Providence.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c010'><sup>[358]</sup></a> The “considerations presented
touching rates,” seem to have accompanied it.
They deserve to be preserved, for many reasons. They
show the unabated zeal of Mr. Williams, for the public
welfare. The opposition to the payment of taxes was a
sore evil, which he often mentioned and condemned:</p>

<p class='c016'>“My good friend, loving remembrance to you. It has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>pleased the Most High and Only Wise, to stir up your
spirit to be one of the chiefest stakes in our poor hedge. I,
therefore, not being able to come to you, present you with
a few thoughts about the great stumbling-block, to them
that are willing to stumble and trouble themselves, our rates.
James Matison had one copy of me, and Thomas Arnold
another. This I send to yourself and the town, (for it may
be I shall not be able to be at meeting.) I am grieved
that you do so much service for so bad recompense; but I
am persuaded you shall find cause to say, the Most High
God of recompense, who was Abraham’s great reward, hath
paid me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div><em>Considerations presented touching rates.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“1. Government and order in families, towns, &amp;c. is
the ordinance of the Most High, Rom. 13, for the peace
and good of mankind. 2. Six things are written in the
hearts of all mankind, yea, even in pagans: 1st. That there
is a Deity; 2d. That some actions are nought; 3d. That
the Deity will punish; 4th. That there is another life; 5th.
That marriage is honorable; 6th. That mankind cannot
keep together without some government. 3. There is no
Englishman in his Majesty’s dominions or elsewhere, who
is not forced to submit to government. 4. There is not a
man in the world, except robbers, pirates and rebels, but
doth submit to government. 5. Even robbers, pirates and
rebels themselves cannot hold together, but by some law
among themselves and government. 6. One of these two
great laws in the world must prevail, either that of judges
and justices of peace in courts of peace, or the law of arms,
the sword and blood. 7. If it comes from the courts of
trials of peace, to the trial of the sword and blood, the conquered
is forced to seek law and government. 8. Till
matters come to a settled government, no man is ordinarily
sure of his house, goods, lands, cattle, wife, children or life.
9. Hence is that ancient maxim, <em>It is better to live under
a tyrant in peace, than under the sword, or where every man
is a tyrant</em>. 10. His Majesty sends governors to Barbadoes,
Virginia, &amp;c. but to us he shews greater favor in our
charter, to choose whom we please. 11. No charters are
obtained without great suit, favor or charges. Our first
cost a hundred pounds (though I never received it all;)
our second about a thousand; Connecticut about six thousand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>&amp;c. 12. No government is maintained without tribute,
custom, rates, taxes, &amp;c. 13. Our charter excels all
in New-England, or <em>in the world, as to the souls of men</em>. 14.
It pleased God, Rom. 13, to command tribute, custom, and
consequently rates, not only for fear, but for conscience
sake. 15. Our rates are the least, by far, of any colony in
New-England. 16. There is no man that hath a vote in
town or colony, but <em>he hath a hand in making the rates by
himself or his deputies</em>. 17. In our colony the General Assembly,
Governor, magistrates, deputies, towns, town-clerks,
raters, constables, &amp;c. have done their duties, the failing
lies upon particular persons. 18. It is but folly to resist,
(one or more, and if one, why not more?) God hath stirred
up the spirit of the Governor, magistrates and officers, driven
to it by necessity, to be unanimously resolved to see the
matter finished; and it is the duty of every man to maintain,
encourage, and strengthen the hand of authority.
19. Black clouds (some years) have hung over Old and
New-England heads. God hath been wonderfully patient
and long-suffering to us; but who sees not changes and
calamities hanging over us? 20. All men fear, that this
blazing herald from heaven<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c010'><sup>[359]</sup></a> denounceth from the Most
High, wars, pestilence, famines; is it not then our wisdom
to make and keep peace with God and man?</p>

<p class='c016'>“My humble respects to Mrs. Bradstreet, and other honored
friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The foregoing letter furnishes proof, that Mr. Williams,
even after Philip’s war, and consequently after he had
passed his 77th year, went to Narraganset, and delivered
discourses. His zeal for the salvation of men was not extinguished
by his age, nor was he prevented from efforts to
save them, by his theory respecting the ministry. That
zeal is displayed in his desire to print these discourses,
after disease confined him to his home. The letter, too,
leads us to infer his poverty. He would not, probably, have
solicited aid to print so small a work, if he had possessed the
means. His son’s letter, quoted in a preceding page,<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c010'><sup>[361]</sup></a> intimates,
that Mr. Williams was dependent on his children,
to some extent, at least, during the last years of his life.
Poverty was honorable in a man, who had spent his best
days in the public service, and who had been more intent
on making others happy, than on the promotion of his
own private interests.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the immediate cause and exact time of Mr. Williams’
death, we are not informed. It is certain, however, that
he died, at some time between January 16, 1682–3, and
May 10, 1683. On the former day, he signed a document
which was intended as a settlement of the controversy respecting
the Pawtuxet lands. On the 10th of May, Mr.
John Thornton wrote to the Rev. Samuel Hubbard, from
Providence: “The Lord hath arrested by death our ancient
and approved friend, Mr. Roger Williams, with divers
others here.”<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c010'><sup>[362]</sup></a> He was in the 84th year of his age. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>would be gratifying to have some account of his last hours,
but we have every reason to believe, that his end was peace.
He “was buried,” says Mr. Callender (p. 93,) “with all the
solemnity the colony was able to show.” His remains were
deposited, in his own family burying-ground, on his town-lot,
a short distance only from the place where he landed,
and from the spot where his dwelling-house stood. His

were living at his death.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c010'><sup>[364]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Thus terminated the long and active life of the founder
of Rhode-Island, fifty-two years of which elapsed, after his
arrival in America. It now remains, to present a summary
view of his writings, and some comments on his character.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Williams’ writings—Key—Bloody Tenet—liberty of conscience—Mr.
Cotton’s Reply—Mr. Williams’ Rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our examination of the writings of Mr. Williams must
be brief. Sufficient specimens of his style have been given
in the preceding pages. We shall, therefore, present no
extracts from his books, except such as may be necessary
to explain their character, or to illustrate his principles.</p>

<p class='c009'>His first printed book was his Key. The title page is
in these words: “A Key into the Language of America,
or a Help to the Language of the Natives, in that part of
America called New-England; together with brief Observations
of the Customs, Manners and Worships, &amp;c. of the
aforesaid Natives, in Peace and War, in Life and Death.
On all which are added, Spiritual Observations, general
and particular, by the Author, of chief and special use
(upon all occasions) to all the English inhabiting those
Parts; yet pleasant and profitable to the View of all Men.
By Roger Williams, of Providence, in New-England. London.
Printed by Gregory Dexter, 1643.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was dedicated “to my dear and well-beloved friends
and countrymen in Old and New-England.” In this dedication,
he says, “This Key respects the native language of
it, and happily may unlock some rarities concerning the
natives themselves, not yet discovered. A little key may
open a box, where lies a bunch of keys.” He professes
his hope, that his book may contribute to the spread of
Christianity among the natives, “being comfortably persuaded,
that that Father of spirits, who was graciously
pleased to persuade Japhet (the Gentile) to dwell in the
tents of Shem (the Jews) will, in his holy season, (I hope
approaching) persuade these Gentiles of America to partake
of the mercies of Europe; and then shall be fulfilled
what is written by the prophet Malachi, from the rising of
the sun (in Europe) to the going down of the same (in
America) my name shall be great among the Gentiles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The book is divided into thirty-two chapters, the titles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>of which are, Of Salutation. Of Eating and Entertainment.
Of Sleep. Of their Numbers. Of Relations and Consanguinity,
&amp;c. Of Houses, Family, &amp;c. Of Parts of Body.
Of Discourse and News. Of Time of Day. Of Seasons of
the Year. Of Travel. Of the Heavenly Lights. Of the
Weather. Of the Winds. Of Fowl. Of the Earth and
Fruits thereof. Of Beasts and Cattle. Of the Sea. Of Fish
and Fishing. Of their Nakedness and Clothing. Of their
Religion, Soul, &amp;c. Of their Government. Of their Marriages.
Of their Coin. Of their Trading. Of their Debts
and Trusting. Of their Hunting. Of their Sports and
Gaming. Of their Wars. Of their Paintings. Of their Sickness.
Of their Death and Burial.</p>

<p class='c009'>The work is ingeniously constructed in such a manner,
as to present a vocabulary of Indian words, with their significations,
while valuable information is given concerning
the various topics enumerated in the titles of the chapters.
Appended to each chapter are some pious reflections, and
a few lines of rude poetry.</p>

<p class='c009'>An extract from the twenty-first chapter, “Of Religion,
the Soul, &amp;c.” will furnish a specimen of the work.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Manit Manittowock, God, Gods.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Obs. He that questions whether God made the world,
the Indians will teach him. I must acknowledge, I have
received, in my converse with them, many confirmations of
those two great points, Heb. 11:6. viz:</p>

<p class='c016'>“1. That God is.</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. That he is a rewarder of all them that diligently
seek him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“They will generally confess that God made all; but
then, in special, although they deny not that Englishman’s
God made English men, and the heavens and earth there;
yet their Gods made them, and the heaven and the earth
where they dwell.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nummus quauna-muckqun manit. God is angry with
me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Obs. I heard a poor Indian lamenting the loss of a
child, at break of day, call up his wife and children, and
all about him, to lamentation, and with abundance of tears,
cry out, O, God, thou hast taken away my child! thou art
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>angry with me: O, turn thine anger from me, and spare
the rest of my children.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If they receive any good in hunting, fishing, harvest,
&amp;c. they acknowledge God in it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yea, if it be but an ordinary accident, a fall, &amp;c. they
will say, God was angry and did it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The work displays genius, industry and benevolence. It
was very valuable when it was written, and it is still one
of the best works on the subject. It breathes, throughout,
a spirit of piety, and it closes in the following devout
strain:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, to the Most High and Most Holy, Immortal, Invisible,
and only wise God, who alone is Alpha and Omega,
the beginning and the ending, the first and the last, who
was, and is, and is to come; from whom, by whom, and to
whom are all things; by whose gracious assistance and
wonderful supportment in so many varieties of hardship
and outward miseries, I have had such converse with barbarous
nations, and have been mercifully assisted, to frame
this poor Key, which may (through his blessing, in his own
holy season,) open a door, yea, doors of unknown mercies
to us and them, be honor, glory, power, riches, wisdom,
goodness and dominion ascribed by all his in Jesus Christ
to eternity. Amen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the original edition, the copy in the library of the
Massachusetts Historical Society is probably the only one
in this country. In the third and fifth volumes of the Society’s
Collections, first series, a large part of the work
was republished. The first volume of the Collections of
the Rhode-Island Historical Society contains a handsome
edition of the Key, with a well written preface, and a brief
memoir of the author.</p>

<p class='c009'>His next publication was entitled “The Bloody Tenet
of Persecution, for Cause of Conscience, discussed, in a
Conference between Truth and Peace, who, in all tender
affection, present to the High Court of Parliament (as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>result of their Discourse) these, (amongst other passages)
of highest consideration. Printed in the year 1644.” It
was published without the name of the author.</p>

<p class='c009'>The origin of this work was this: A person, who was
confined in Newgate, on account of his religious opinions,
wrote a paper against persecution. “Having not the use
of pen and ink, he wrote these arguments in milk, in sheets
of paper, brought to him by the woman, his keeper, from a
friend in London, as the stopples of his milk bottle. In
such paper, written with milk, nothing will appear; but
the way of reading it by fire being known to this friend,
who received the papers, he transcribed and kept together
the papers.”<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c010'><sup>[365]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This essay was sent to Mr. Cotton, of Boston. He
wrote a reply, of which Mr. Williams’ book is an examination.
Its title, “The Bloody Tenet,” is a fanciful reference
to the circumstance, that the original paper of the
prisoner was written with milk. “These arguments against
such persecution, and the answer pleading for it, written
(as love hopes) from godly intentions, hearts and hands, yet
in a marvellous different style and manner—the arguments
against persecution in <em>milk</em>, the answer for it (as I may say)
in <em>blood</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The book is dedicated “To the Right Honorable, both
Houses of the High Court of Parliament.” After an address
“To every courteous reader,” and a minute table of
contents, the essay of the prisoner and Mr. Cotton’s reply
are inserted. Then follows the main work, divided into
one hundred and thirty-eight short chapters, eighty-one of
which are employed in discussing Mr. Cotton’s reply, and
the remainder in examining “A Model of Church and
Civil Power, composed by Mr. Cotton and the Ministers of
New-England, and sent to the Church at Salem, as a further
Confirmation of the Bloody Doctrine of Persecution
for Cause of Conscience.” The whole work forms a small
quarto, of two hundred and forty-seven pages. A few
copies exist, in the large libraries in this country.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c010'><sup>[366]</sup></a> It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>ought to be reprinted, and it is hoped that the Rhode-Island
Historical Society will make it one of the volumes
of their Collections. It is the best work of its author, and
it contains a full exhibition of his principles. Its style is
animated, and often beautiful.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c010'><sup>[367]</sup></a> It is in the form of a dialogue
between Truth and Peace, and the colloquy is sustained
with great skill. It commences thus:</p>

<p class='c016'>“<em>Truth.</em> In what dark corner of the world (sweet
Peace) are we two met? How hath this present evil world
banished me from all the coasts and quarters of it, and how
hath the righteous God in judgment taken thee from the
earth? Rev. 6:4.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<em>Peace.</em> ’Tis lamentably true, (blessed Truth) the foundations
of the world have long been out of course. The
gates of earth and hell have conspired together to intercept
our joyful meeting, and our holy kisses. With what a
weary, tired wing, have I flown over nations, kingdoms,
cities, towns, to find out precious Truth.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<em>Truth.</em> The like inquiries, in my flights and travels,
have I made for Peace, and still am told, she hath left the
earth and fled to heaven.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<em>Peace.</em> Dear Truth, what is the earth but a dungeon
of darkness, where Truth is not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>An analysis of this book would occupy too much space.
The author himself presents a summary view of its contents
in the introduction:</p>

<p class='c016'>“First. That the blood of so many hundred thousand souls
of protestants and papists, spilt in the wars of present and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>former ages, for their respective consciences, is not required
nor accepted by Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Secondly. Pregnant Scriptures and arguments are
throughout the work proposed against the doctrine of persecution
for cause of conscience.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Thirdly. Satisfactory answers are given to Scriptures,
and objections produced by Mr. Calvin, Beza, Mr. Cotton,
and the ministers of the New English churches, and others
former and later, tending to prove the doctrine of persecution
for cause of conscience.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Fourthly. The doctrine of persecution for cause of
conscience, is proved guilty of all the blood of the souls
crying for vengeance under the altar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Fifthly. All civil states, with their officers of justice, in
the irrespective constitutions and administrations, are proved
essentially civil, and therefore not judges, governors, or
defenders of the spiritual or Christian state and worship.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sixthly. It is the will and command of God, that since
the coming of his Son, the Lord Jesus, a permission of the
most Paganish, Jewish, Turkish or Antichristian consciences
and worships, be granted to all men in all nations
and countries: and they are to be fought against with that
sword, which is only in soul matters able to conquer, to
wit, the sword of God’s Spirit, the word of God.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Seventhly. The state of the land of Israel, the kings
and people thereof, in peace and war, is proved figurative
and ceremonial, and no pattern nor precedent for any kingdom
or civil state in the world to follow.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Eighthly. God requireth not a uniformity of religion
to be enacted or enforced in any civil state; which enforced
uniformity sooner or later is the greatest occasion of
civil war, ravishing of conscience, persecution of Christ
Jesus in his servants, and of the hypocrisy and destruction
of millions of souls.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ninthly. In holding an enforced uniformity of religion
in a civil state, we must necessarily disclaim our desires
and hopes of the Jews’ conversion to Christ.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Tenthly. An enforced uniformity of religion throughout
a nation or civil state, confounds the civil and religious,
denies the principles of Christianity and civility, and that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Eleventhly. The permission of other consciences and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>worships, than a state professeth, only can according to
God procure a firm and lasting peace, good assurance
being taken according to the wisdom of the civil state for
uniformity of civil obedience from all sorts.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Twelfthly. Lastly, true civility and christianity may
both flourish in a state or kingdom, notwithstanding the
permission of divers and contrary consciences, either of
Jews or Gentiles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without examining the numerous arguments and texts,
with which Mr. Williams fortifies his doctrine, we will
briefly state the general principles of liberty of conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>All men are bound by the laws of God, and are responsible
to Him for their conduct. He requires them to love,
worship and obey Him. From this duty, they cannot be
released. The conscience cannot be freed from this obligation.
God has not granted any liberty to disobey His
commands.</p>

<p class='c009'>As God is the Supreme Ruler, He may prescribe the
modes in which He chooses to be worshipped, and may
enforce conformity by temporal penalties. This he did
in the Jewish commonwealth. He established a system of
rites, and armed the magistrate with power to coerce the
consciences of the Jews. The civil sword was rightly used
to maintain the national religion, because the magistrate
acted in the name and by the authority of Jehovah. The
destruction of several heathen nations, by the Jews, was
just, because God commanded the act. He uses what instruments
he pleases to punish men, and the chastisement
was deserved, whether it was inflicted by the Jewish
sword, or by famine or pestilence.</p>

<p class='c009'>But since the introduction of the christian system, the
case is altered. The obligation to love God and obey the
Gospel, binds the conscience of every man; but he is responsible
to God alone. His fellow men have no right to
interfere. God has not delegated to any man this authority
over the conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>All human laws, therefore, which either prescribe or
prohibit certain doctrines or rites, that are not inconsistent
with the civil peace, are unjust, and are an invasion
of the prerogatives of God. They are consequently null
and void, and no man is bound to obey them. The reasons
are obvious:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Such laws are inconsistent with the spirit and letter of
the New Testament. The Saviour gave no intimation to
his ministers, that force should be employed in the diffusion
of his Gospel. He appointed, on the contrary, the
preaching of the truth, an appeal to the understandings and
hearts of men, as the means by which his kingdom was
to be established. His apostles accordingly went abroad
among the nations, proclaiming the Gospel, and by moral
suasion, endeavoring to bring men to the obedience of
faith. They represented themselves to be ambassadors,
commissioned to declare the will of their Sovereign, but
not authorized to employ force. “We are ambassadors
for Christ; as though God did <em>beseech</em> you by us, we <em>pray</em>
you, in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.” “Knowing,
therefore, the terror of the Lord, we <em>persuade</em> men.”<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c010'><sup>[368]</sup></a>
The great commission of the ministers of the Gospel is,
“Go ye into all the world, and <em>preach the Gospel</em> to every
creature; he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved,
but he that believeth not shall be damned.”<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c010'><sup>[369]</sup></a> The only
legitimate means, therefore, of operating on the wills of
men, in reference to religion, are the affecting truths, the
precious promises, and the terrific threatenings of the word
of God. These are to be presented to the minds and hearts
of men, with solemnity and urgent affection; but here the
agency of man ceases. If men choose to disobey the Gospel,
they do it on their responsibility to God, who will bring
them into judgment for the deeds done in the body.</p>

<p class='c009'>The early believers acted on this principle; and after
Christians obtained possession of the civil power, the employment
of force to constrain the conscience was not introduced,
till the purity of Christianity became corrupted
by her alliance with the state.<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c010'><sup>[370]</sup></a> The remark of Tertullian,<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c010'><sup>[371]</sup></a>
expresses the feelings of the early Christians: “It is the
natural civil right of every man to worship whatever he
pleases. It is inconsistent with the nature of religion to
propagate it by force, for it must be received by voluntary
consent, not by coercion.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>This remark suggests another argument. Religion essentially
consists in love to God. Its seat is the soul.
External acts of worship are merely manifestations of this
inward principle, and derive from it all their value. When
they do not spring from it, they are not acceptable to God.
The principle may exist, in vigor and purity, without any
external expressions; and much of the intercourse of every
Christian with God consists in this silent communion of
his soul with the great Invisible. But, from the nature of
man, he needs external modes of manifesting his feelings,
in order to preserve those feelings in healthful action.
God accordingly requires worship, and obedience to certain
rites. The social principle is brought into action, and
individual Christians increase their own strength, by union
with their fellow Christians in acts of devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when force is employed, to constrain men to the
performance of religious duties, the end proposed is not
attained. Men may be made to assume attitudes, and to
repeat words, and to visit certain places; but they cannot
be forced, by human power, to love God. They cannot
thus be made religious. The soul is not subject to human
constraint. Men cannot penetrate the interior sanctuary,
where she resides, in the awful presence of God alone. It
is absurd, therefore, to attempt to accomplish, by human
laws, what they are incompetent, from their nature, to
effect. No legislator ever enacted a law, requiring the citizens
to love the state. The law provides for the punishment
of actions inconsistent with this love; but beyond
the external manifestations of the inward feelings, it does
not attempt to extend its jurisdiction. Laws requiring
men to perform religious duties are vain, as well as unjust.
They attempt an impossibility, because the duty is not performed,
unless it springs from love to God; which love no
human power can create in the soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>But such laws are unjust, because God has given to men
no power over the conscience, and because men cannot
grant this power to each other. Civil society is necessary
to the happiness of men, and a sufficient amount of power
must be confided to the hands of rulers, for the protection
of society. But the degree of this delegated authority is
limited by its objects. The regulation of the conscience
is not one of the purposes for which men combine in civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>society. The object of such a society is the promotion of
civil interests. Those interests must be guarded and promoted.
Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness must be
secured to every citizen. When these ends are attained,
government has fulfilled its purpose. It has no power to
dictate to the citizen, in what mode he shall pursue happiness.
It cannot interfere with his domestic or social relations,
unless the public welfare is injured. It cannot, above
all, intrude into the hallowed asylum, where the religious
affections reign. It is inconsistent with the theory of the
social compact, to suppose, that men have surrendered to
the state the right to control their faith,—a surrender which
is not necessary to the ends for which men unite in political
communities.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if men were willing to yield this right, they could
not do it. God holds every man personally responsible.
Every individual must stand at the judgment seat of Christ,
and give an account of his own actions. No man, therefore,
can surrender to another the control over his conscience.
His soul is committed to his own responsibility,
and of him God will require it. He must not commit himself
implicitly to the control or guidance of any man; but,
seeking for light from Heaven, he must strive for the perfection
of his moral nature, and for a preparation for the
eternal life beyond the grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>The absurdity of permitting the civil magistrate to regulate
the conscience, is shown by the fact, that the magistrate
will make his own views the standard of orthodoxy;
and, consequently, it has happened, that successive
rulers have maintained, by force, totally opposite systems
of faith and practice. Mr. Williams says, on this
point, “Who knows not, that within the compass of one
poor span of twelve years’ revolution, all England hath become
from half Papist, half Protestant, to be absolute
Protestants; from absolute Protestants to be absolute Papists;
from absolute Papists, (changing as fashions) to absolute
Protestants.”<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c010'><sup>[372]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The magistrate must be infallible, in order to be a safe
guide to the consciences of men. This consideration is a
sufficient answer to Mr. Cotton’s sophism, that a man must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>not be persecuted for his opinions, but he may be punished
for acting in contradiction to his own conscience. But
who is to be the judge? Fundamentals, says Mr. Cotton,
are so clear, that a man must be criminally blind and obstinate,
who does not receive and obey them. But what
are these fundamentals? is a question which different
magistrates will decide differently; and men may be successively
rewarded and punished, by successive administrations,
for the same opinions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great and true principle, then, is, that men are not
responsible to each other, for their religious opinions or
practices, as such; and that every man has a right, as a
citizen, to hold any opinions, and to practise any ceremonies,
which he pleases, unless he disturbs the civil peace.
The duty of the magistrate, in relation to religion, consists
in personal obedience to the truth, and impartial protection
to all the citizens in the exercise of their religious
privileges. Mr. Williams has well stated this point. In
answer to the question, “What may the magistrate lawfully
do with his civil power in matters of religion?” he
says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The civil magistrate either respecteth that religion and
worship, which his conscience is persuaded is true and
upon which he ventures his soul; or else, that and those
which he is persuaded are false. Concerning the first, if
that which the magistrate believeth to be true, be true, I say
he owes a three-fold duty to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First, approbation and countenance, a reverent esteem
and honorable testimony (according to Isaiah 49, and
Rev. 31) with a tender respect of truth, and of the professors
of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Secondly, personal submission of his own soul to the
power of the Lord Jesus, in that spiritual government and
kingdom, according to Matt. 18, and 1 Cor. 5.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thirdly, protection of such true professors of Christ,
whether apart, or met together, as also of their estates,
from violence or injury, according to Rom. 13.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, secondly, if it be a false religion (unto which the
civil magistrate dare not adjoin,) yet he owes:</p>

<p class='c009'>“First, <em>permission</em> (for <em>approbation</em> he owes not to what
is evil) and thus according to Matthew 13: 30, for public
peace and quiet sake.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>“Secondly, he owes protection to the persons of his subjects
(though of a false worship) that no injury be offered
either to the persons or goods of any. Rom. 13.”<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c010'><sup>[373]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>It follows, from this last position, that no man can be
lawfully compelled to support a system of worship which he
disapproves; for this is, in effect, to tax and punish him for
his religious opinions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The duty of the magistrate is thus very clear. With
the religious opinions or practices of the citizens, he has no
concern. They are not civil matters, which, alone, come
within his cognizance. If a man’s religious views lead
him to actions which injure society, those actions become
civil offences, and are within the jurisdiction of the magistrate,
who is appointed to guard the interests of the civil
community. If a company of Hindoos should remove to
Boston, and should erect a temple to Juggernaut, they
ought to be protected in their worship, if they confined themselves
to such acts, as made no disturbance, and violated
no civil law. If, however, they should attempt to drag the
idol through the streets, the magistrates ought to interfere.
If they should sacrifice one of their children, the perpetrators
ought to be tried and punished for murder. If a man
violates the third commandment, in such a way as to disturb
the community, he may be punished, though experience
has proved, that it is not wise to enforce laws against
blasphemy. If a man breaks the fourth commandment, by
actions which interrupt or disturb the devotions of others,
the law may restrain and punish him, not for the breach of
the commandment, but for interfering with the religious
privileges of other citizens. If a man chose to labor on
the Sabbath, on his farm or in his shop, the law could not
rightfully interfere; but if by his labor he disturbed the devotions
of his neighbors, he might be restrained; though,
here, too, experience proves, that the interference of the
law is odious, and seldom beneficial.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such cases as those specified present no difficulty.
There is a broad, clear line, running between religious
opinions and actions. The actions, and not the opinions,
are the subjects of law. If it is alleged, that the opinions
necessarily lead to illegal conduct, the reply is, wait till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>the actions are attempted or performed. They, then,
come within the cognizance of civil law. If, indeed, a
case could be supposed to happen, in which a religious
sect avowed it as their creed, that they were required, or
permitted, to murder their fellow-citizens, or burn their
dwellings, the magistrates would be bound to take the necessary
precautions to prevent such results. In such a
case, the creed would involve a criminal design, against
which the community would have a right to guard itself;
but the mere design could not be punished; just as a purpose
to commit murder cannot be punished, though it justifies
the magistrate in taking measures to prevent its execution.</p>

<p class='c009'>Liberty of conscience, however, has some limitations.
It does not prohibit churches from excluding members
whose opinions or conduct are inconsistent with the principles
on which the church is founded. The Bible makes
it the duty of churches to maintain suitable discipline. A
church is a voluntary society, founded on certain fundamental
rules, to which every member assents, when he enters
it. If he adopts other principles, or in any way violates
the rules, he makes himself liable to expulsion from
the church, as from any other voluntary association.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neither does liberty of conscience imply, that a man
has a claim to our confidence, our patronage, our votes,
whatever may be his religious opinions. I would not intrust
my children to the care of an infidel, but I do not
deprive him, by such refusal, of any right; yet a law forbidding
infidels to be employed as instructors, would be unjust.
I would not vote for a man holding certain principles,
but I do not thereby invade his privileges, for he
has no title to my vote; yet a law, making men ineligible
to office, on account of certain opinions, would be an invasion
of their civil rights.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c010'><sup>[374]</sup></a> Every man must bear the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>responsibility of his principles. Those principles cannot
impair his positive rights; but they may, and will, affect
the opinions and feelings of his fellow men. To their confidence,
their patronage, or their votes, he has no natural
right, and no civil injustice is done to him, if these are
withheld.</p>

<p class='c009'>We cannot prolong our remarks on this subject. It is
expounded and illustrated, with much ability, learning and
eloquence, in the “Bloody Tenet.” Roger Williams is
entitled to the honor of being the first writer, in modern
times, who clearly maintained the absolute right of every
man, to a “full liberty in religious concernments.” Bishop
Heber, in his Life of Jeremy Taylor, says, of the “Liberty
of Prophesying,” “It is the first attempt on record, to conciliate
the minds of Christians to the reception of a doctrine,
which, though now the rule of action professed by
all Christian sects, was then, by every sect alike, regarded
as a perilous and portentous novelty.”<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c010'><sup>[375]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Bishop Heber has here fallen into a mistake. The
“Liberty of Prophesying” was published in 1647, three
years after the “Bloody Tenet,” in which the principles of
religious liberty are more clearly and consistently maintained,
than in Taylor’s excellent work.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c010'><sup>[376]</sup></a> Bishop Heber
admits (p. 222) that this essay “can by no means lay claim
to the character which has been assigned to it, of a plea
for universal toleration. The forbearance which he claims,
<em>he claims for those Christians only, who unite in the confession
of the Apostles’ creed</em>.” Bishop Taylor himself, at
the end of the sixteenth section of the work referred to,
says, that “opinions are to be dealt with,” if they tend to
disturb the public peace, and lead to vice. “If either
themselves or their doctrine do really and without color or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>feigned pretence, disturb the public peace, and just interests,
they are not to be suffered.” But the magistrate must
judge, in this case; and, of course, the door is left wide
open, for persecution. Roger Williams, on the contrary,
contended, that “a permission of the most Paganish,
Jewish, Turkish or Antichristian consciences and worships,
be granted to all men in all nations and countries;”
and he left no discretion to the magistrate to judge of
opinions, any further than they should exhibit their effects
in action. His principles, too, claimed for men entire <em>liberty
of conscience</em>, and not merely a right to <em>toleration</em>. To
tolerate implies the power to interfere, and to regulate the
conscience. If there is power to <em>permit</em>, there is power to
<em>forbid</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great Mr. Locke advocated the principles of religious
liberty with distinguished ability, in his Letters concerning
Toleration, written about the year 1690; but he
maintained, by implication, that Papists ought not to be
tolerated, and expressly asserted that atheists must not receive
toleration.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c010'><sup>[377]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>We may here take notice of an attempt to deprive Roger
Williams and his colony of their just praise, by claiming
for Lord Baltimore the priority in establishing religious liberty
in Maryland. We would not detract from the merit
of Lord Baltimore and his colony; but the liberty established
in Maryland, though far beyond the spirit of those
times, did not rise to the Rhode-Island standard. It extended
only to Christians.<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c010'><sup>[378]</sup></a> Lord Baltimore commenced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>his settlement in 1634, and established Christianity, agreeably
to the old common law, without allowing pre-eminence
to any particular sect. This was wise and liberal; but
Mr. Williams established his colony in 1636, two years
afterwards, on the broad principle of unlimited religious
freedom; and the Jew, the Mahometan or the Hindoo
might have found a home in Rhode-Island, and might
have enjoyed his opinions unmolested, while he fulfilled his
civil duties. The first law of Maryland, respecting religious
liberty, was enacted in 1649. In 1647, at the first
General Assembly held in Rhode-Island, under the first
charter, a code of laws was adopted, relating exclusively
to civil concerns, and concluding with these words: “Otherwise
than thus, what is herein forbidden, <em>all men may
walk as their consciences persuade them, every one in the
name of his God. And let the lambs of the Most High
walk in this colony without molestation, in the name of
Jehovah their God, forever and ever.</em>”<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c010'><sup>[379]</sup></a> This noble provision
was a part of the code; and it was not only prior in
date to the law of Maryland, but it was more liberal, and
more consistent with the rights of conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must now return to Mr. Williams’ book. A reply
was written by Mr. Cotton, and published in London, in
1647. Its title was: “The Bloody Tenet washed, and
made white, in the Blood of the Lamb, being discussed
and discharged of Blood-Guiltiness, by just Defence.
Wherein the great Questions of this Time are handled,
viz. How far Liberty of Conscience ought to be given to
those that truly fear God, and how far restraint to turbulent
and pestilent Persons, that not only rase the Foundation of
Godliness, but disturb the civil Peace, where they live.
Also, how far the Magistrates may proceed in the Duties
of the first Table. And that all Magistrates ought to study
the Word and Will of God, that they may frame their Government
according to it. Discussed, as they are alleged,
from divers Scriptures, out of the Old and New Testaments.
Wherein also the Practice of Princes is debated,
together with the Judgment of ancient and late Writers,
of most precious Esteem. Whereunto is added, a Reply
to Mr. Williams’ Answer to Mr. Cotton’s Letter. By John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>Cotton, Bachelor in Divinity, and Teacher of the Church
of Christ, at Boston, in New-England. London, printed
by Matthew Symmons, for Hannah Allen, at the Crown,
in Pope’s-Head Alley. 1647.” The book is a small
quarto, of 339 pages. It is able and learned, but it maintains
the right of the magistrate to interfere, for the promotion
of truth, and the suppression of error.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams again took up his pen, and published a rejoinder,
entitled, “The Bloody Tenet yet more Bloody, by
Mr. Cotton’s Endeavor to wash it white in the Blood of the
Lamb. Of whose precious Blood, spilt in the Blood of his
Servants, and of the Blood of Millions spilt in former and
later Wars for Conscience Sake, that most bloody Tenet
of Persecution for Cause of Conscience, upon a second
Trial, is found now more apparently and more notoriously
guilty. In this Rejoinder to Mr. Cotton, are principally,
I. The Nature of Persecution. II. The Power of the
civil Sword in Spirituals, examined. III. The Parliament’s
Permission of Dissenting Consciences justified.
Also, (as a Testimony to Mr. Clarke’s Narrative) is added,
a Letter to Mr. Endicott, Governor of the Massachusetts,
in New-England. By R. Williams, of Providence, in New-England.
London, printed for Giles Calvert, and are to be
sold at the Black-Spread-Eagle, at the West End of Paul’s,
1652.” It is a small quarto, of 302 pages.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c010'><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This book discusses the same topics, as its predecessor,
with additional arguments. Though the controversy was
maintained with spirit, yet the tone of the book is courteous.
Mr. Williams says: “The Most Holy and All-Seeing
knows, how bitterly I resent [lament] the least difference
with Mr. Cotton, yea with the least of the followers of Jesus,
of what conscience or worship soever.” He calls his book,
“An Examination of the worthily honored and beloved Mr.
Cotton’s Reply.” It would be well if all disputants cherished
the same kind spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The book contains an “Address to the High Court of
Parliament,” in which the author prays them to favor toleration,
and to secure their personal salvation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>There are also two addresses, the one “to the several
respective General Courts, especially that of the Massachusetts,
in New-England,” and the other “To the Merciful
and Compassionate Reader.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The body of the work is written, like the Bloody Tenet,
in the form of a “Conference between Truth and Peace,”
and is divided into chapters, in each of which, for the most
part, a corresponding chapter of Mr. Cotton’s book is examined.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the close of the examination, is a letter to Governor
Endicott, of Massachusetts, in which Mr. Williams expresses
great affection for him, alludes to former days, and
exhibitions of a different spirit, intimates that the love of
honor had affected the Governor, beseeches him to adopt
and practise the principles of toleration, and assures him,
that if he should follow out his principles he must proceed
to bloodshed. This prediction was soon after fulfilled in the
execution of the Quakers.</p>

<p class='c009'>In an appendix, is an address “To the Clergy of the four
great Parties (professing the name of Christ Jesus) in England,
Scotland and Ireland, viz. the Popish, Prelatical,
Presbyterian and Independent.” It is mild and respectful,
though it accuses them all of persecuting each other, when
they possessed the power. He says: “Just like two men,
whom I have known break out to blows and wrestling, so
have the Protestant Bishops wrestled with the Popish, and
the Popish with the Protestant, the Presbyterian with the
Independent, and the Independent with the Presbyterian.
And our chronicles and experiences have told this nation
and the world, how he whose turn it is to be brought under,
hath ever felt a heavy, wrathful hand of an unbrotherly and
unchristian persecution,” (p. 316.) He says, that they all
pleaded for freedom when they were persecuted, and adds,
“What excellent subscriptions to this soul freedom are interwoven
in many passages of the late King’s book (if
his.)”<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c010'><sup>[381]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>He alludes to the ejected clergy, and makes the following
appeal, which is very honorable to his feelings:—“I
make another humble plea (and that, I believe, with all the
reason and justice in the world) that such who are ejected,
undone, impoverished, might, some way, from the state or
you, receive relief and succor; considering that the very
nation’s constitution hath occasioned parents to train up,
and persons to give themselves to studies (though, in truth,
but in a way of trading and bargaining before God) yet it
is according to the custom of the nation, who ought, therefore,
to share also in the fault of such parents and ministers,
who, in all changes, are ejected.” How different is
this language from that of a rash, proscriptive reformer,
who, in his zeal for what he esteems right, disregards every
consideration of justice or humanity! The clergy whom
Mr. Williams had especially in view were the Episcopal
ministers, who had been expelled from their benefices. He
did not believe them, in general, to be fit to preach, but he
wished them to be treated with kindness and liberality.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Hireling Ministry none of Christ’s—the ministry—controversy with
George Fox—other writings—character as a writer—his general
character.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same year, 1652, in which the last mentioned
book was published, Mr. Williams printed a pamphlet, with
the title, “The Hireling Ministry none of Christ’s, or a
Discourse touching the Propagating the Gospel of Christ
Jesus. Humbly presented to such pious and honorable
hands, whom the present debate thereof concerns. By
Roger Williams, of Providence, in New-England. London.
Printed in the second month.” It is a small quarto, of thirty-six
pages. No copy is known to the writer to exist in this
country, except in the Library of the American Antiquarian
Society, in Worcester, which contains a duplicate.
One of the copies was loaned to the author, by the politeness
of the Librarian.</p>

<p class='c009'>This pamphlet is valuable, because it contains a more
clear exposition of Mr. Williams’ views respecting the
ministry, than any other of his works. It begins with an
“Epistle Dedicatory, to all such honorable and pious hands,
whom the present debate touching the propagating of
Christ’s Gospel concerns; and to all such gentle Bereans,
who, with ingenious civility, desire to search, whether
what’s presented concerning Christ Jesus be so or not.”
In this epistle, the author says, “I have not been altogether
a stranger to the learning of the Egyptians, and have trod
the hopefullest paths to worldly preferment, which, for
Christ’s sake, I have forsaken. I know what it is to study,
to preach, to be an elder, to be applauded, and yet also
what it is to tug at the oar, to dig with the spade and
plough, and to labor and travel day and night, amongst
English, amongst barbarians.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief purpose of the work is, to oppose a legal
establishment of religion, and the compulsory support of
the clergy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The principal points maintained are three: 1. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>now no ministry, which is authorized to preach to the
heathen, or to exercise pastoral functions. 2. There ought
to be a perfect liberty to all men to maintain such worship
and ministry as they please. 3. Ministers ought be supported,
by voluntary donations, and not by legal provision.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. On the first point, he partially stated his views, in his
preceding works on the Bloody Tenet; but in this pamphlet,
he expounds them more fully. His opinions appear to have
rested entirely on a misconception of passages in the Revelations.
He believed, that the “white troopers” mentioned
in the 6th and 19th chapters of Revelations, were the true
ministers, and that they were utterly routed, till after the
slaying of the witnesses and their resurrection. “The
apostolical commission and ministry is long since interrupted
and discontinued, yet ever since the beast Antichrist
rose, the Lord Jesus hath stirred up the ministry of prophecy,
who must continue their witness and prophecy, until
their witness be finished, and slaughters, probably near
approaching, be accomplished.” “In the poor small span
of my life, I desired to have been a diligent and constant
observer, and have been myself many ways engaged, in
city, in country, in court, in schools, in universities, in
churches, in Old and New-England; and yet cannot, in
the holy presence of God, bring in the result of a satisfying
discovery, that either the begetting ministry of the
apostles or messengers to the churches, or the feeding and
nourishing ministry of pastors and teachers, according to
the first institution of the Lord Jesus, are yet restored and
extant.”—p. 4.</p>

<p class='c009'>In his “Bloody Tenet made more Bloody,” he says, that
“Christ Jesus sends out preachers three ways: 1st. In his
own person, as the twelve and seventy. 2dly. By his visible,
kingly power, left in the hands of his true churches, and
the officers and governors thereof. 3dly. Christ Jesus, as
King of the Church and Head of his body, during the distractions
of his house and kingdom, under Antichrist’s
apostacy, immediately by his own Holy Spirit, stirs up and
sends out those fiery witnesses to testify against Antichrist
and his several abominations.”—p. 99.</p>

<p class='c009'>He says, in the work before us: “All (of what rank
soever) that have knowledge and utterance of heavenly
mysteries, and therein are the Lord’s prophets and witnesses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>against Antichrist, must prophesy against false Christs,
false faith, false love, false joy, false worship and ministrations,
false hope and false Heaven, which poor souls in
a golden dream expect and look for.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This prophecy ought to be (chiefly) exercised among
the saints, in the companies, meetings and assemblies of
the fellow-mourners, and witnesses against the falsehoods
of Antichrist. If any come in (as 1 Cor: 14,) yea, if they
come to <em>catch</em>, God will graciously more or less vouchsafe
to <em>catch them</em>, if he intends to save them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But for the going out to the nations, cities, towns, as
to the nations, cities, and towns of the world, unconverted,
until the downfall of the Papacy, (Rev. 18,) and so the
mounting of the Lord Jesus and his white troopers again
(Rev. 19, &amp;c.) for the going out to preach upon hire; for
the going out to convert sinners, and yet to hold communion
with them as saints in prayer; for the going out without
such a powerful call from Christ, as the twelve and
the seventy had, or without such suitable gifts as the first
ministry was furnished with, and this especially without a
due knowledge of the prophecies to be fulfilled, I have
no faith to act, nor in the actings and ministries of others.”—pp.
21, 22.</p>

<p class='c009'>He avers, nevertheless, that he had strong desires to labor
for the good of all men: “By the merciful assistance of the
Most High, I have desired to labor in Europe, in America,
with English, with Barbarians, yea, and also, I have
longed after some trading with the Jews themselves, for
whose hard measure, I fear the nations and England hath
yet a score to pay.”—p. 13. He states his opinion, however,
that no remarkable conversion of the nations is yet
to be expected, because smoke filled the temple till Antichrist
was overthrown. Rev. 15: 8.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the “Bloody Tenet made more Bloody,” he says, on
this subject, that though he approved endeavors to teach
the Indians, yet, “that any of the ministers spoken of are
furnished with true apostolical commission (Matt. 28,) I
see not, for these reasons: 1st. The ordinary ministry, is
not the apostolical, Eph. 4. 1 Cor. 12. 2dly. The churches
of New-England are not pure churches. 3dly. Men cannot
preach to the Indians in any propriety of their speech
or language.”—p. 219.</p>

<p class='c009'>These extracts sufficiently explain his views. It is remarkable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>that a man, whose mind was so strong and clear,
on most subjects, should become perplexed with such difficulties,
in relation to the ministry and the church. That
the passages in the Apocalypse, to which he refers, do not
authorize his conclusions, we need not attempt to prove.
He might well deny, that most of the communities which
then claimed to be Christian churches, were entitled to the
name; and might, with truth, maintain, that a large proportion
of those who professed, at that time, to be ministers
of Christ, were not sanctioned by his commission. But it
did not follow, that no church, formed according to the
models furnished in the New Testament, then existed, and
that no true ministers could be found. A company of true
believers, united in one society, for worship, for mutual
watchfulness, for the maintenance of discipline, and for the
celebration of the ordinances, is a church. A pious man,
who can teach others, and who is moved, by a proper
conviction of duty, and is authorized by a church, to preach
the Gospel, is a duly appointed minister. It is manifest,
from the tenor of the New Testament, that an order of
ministers was intended to be continued. The same ends
for which the first ministers were appointed,—the conversion
of the impenitent, and the edification of believers,—still
require, that, ministers be employed in the work of
spreading and upholding Christianity. The same means
are to be employed,—the declaration of divine truth. The
supernatural gifts of the first ministers were necessary, as
an attestation of the truth of Christianity; but it was not
by the miracles, but by the truth, accompanied by the influences
of the Holy Spirit, that men were converted. The
experience of modern missions demonstrates, that men can
learn to speak “with propriety” the languages of the heathen,
and that the Gospel, when preached now, in Burmah, or
in Hindostan, or in Greenland, or in our western forests, is
“the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.”
Rom. 1: 16.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it is needless to argue a point, so clear as this. Mr.
Williams’ erroneous views on the subject before us, did not
affect his feelings on the great question of religious liberty.
He was willing, that others should establish churches and
maintain ministers, if they chose. This is the second point
which we mentioned.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>2. He says, “I desire not that liberty to myself, which
I would not freely and impartially weigh out to all the consciences
of the world beside. And, therefore, I do humbly
conceive, that it is the will of the Most High, and the express
and absolute duty of the civil powers, to proclaim an
absolute freedom in all the three nations, yea, in all the
world, (were their power so large) that each town and division
of people, yea, and each person, may freely enjoy what
worship, what ministry, what maintenance to afford them,
their soul desireth.”—p. 19. In a subsequent page, he
adds: “All these consciences (yea, the very consciences
of the Papists, Jews, &amp;c. as I have proved at large in my
answer to Master Cotton’s washings) ought freely and impartially
to be permitted their several respective worships,
their ministers of worships, and what way of maintaining
them, they freely choose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>3. On the subject of maintenance, he strongly objects
to a “stated salary,” by which he evidently means a stipend,
fixed and raised by law. He contends, that ministers
ought to be supported, like the first preachers, by voluntary
donations. He does not fully explain his views, but
it does not appear, that he had any objection to a fixed
sum, or to any particular mode of collecting it, provided
that it was voluntarily paid. The compulsory maintenance
of the clergy, by tithes, and other modes of taxation, without
any concurrence of the persons taxed, was the system
against which he argued. He insisted, nevertheless, that
ministers are entitled to a maintenance, and that the members
of a church may be compelled, by the proper use of
spiritual power, to perform their duty, in contributing to
the support of a minister. In the “Bloody Tenet,” (p.
168) he says: “To that Scripture, Gal. 6: 6. ‘Let him
that is taught in the word make him that teacheth partake
of all his goods,’ I answer, that teaching was of persons
converted, believers entered into the school and family of
Christ, the Church, which Church, being rightly gathered,
is also rightly invested with the power of the Lord Jesus, to
force every soul therein by spiritual weapons and penalties
to do its duty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctrines of Roger Williams, on this subject, as well
as on the general principle of liberty of conscience, are rapidly
gaining the victory over the old system. A legal provision
for the clergy, by which all the citizens are compelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>to pay for the support of religious teachers, whether they
choose to hear them or not, is unjust in principle, and
pernicious in practice; producing discontent and odium
among the people, and tending to introduce mere worldly
and mercenary men into the ministry. Its effects, even in
Massachusetts, have convinced men, of all parties, of its
inexpediency. It is a coincidence, which the author
views with pleasure, that, while this book has been passing
through the press, the citizens of Massachusetts have
adopted an amendment of the Constitution, which, in its
results, will sweep away the last relic of the old system.
The principles of Roger Williams will soon be triumphantly
established in Massachusetts, and there will not be,
even in theory, any dominant and favored sect, in this venerable
commonwealth. In every other State in our Union,
entire religious freedom is enjoyed. In England, the march
is onward. In a few years, her establishment must fall,
and religion be placed, where it should be, under the protection
of the Saviour, drawing her revenues from the willing
hands of his followers, and renewing her strength and
beauty, by taking her appropriate station, like the angel in
the sun, high above the contaminations of the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The book before us ends, with what the author calls the
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa totalis</span></i>:”</p>

<p class='c009'>“1st. The civil state is bound, before God, to take off
that bond and yoke of soul oppression [the national establishment]
and to proclaim free and impartial liberty to all
the people of the three nations, to choose and maintain
what worship and ministry their souls and consciences are
persuaded of.</p>

<p class='c009'>“2dly. The civil state is humbly to be implored to provide,
in their high wisdom, for the security of all these respective
consciences, in their respective meetings, assemblings,
worshippings, preachings, disputings, &amp;c. and that
civil peace, and the beauty of civility and humanity, be
maintained among the chief opposers and dissenters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“3dly. It is the duty of all that are in authority, and of
all that are able, to countenance, and encourage and supply
all such true volunteers, as give and devote themselves
to the service and ministry of Christ Jesus in any kind;
although it be also the duty, and will be the practice, of all
such, whom the Spirit of God sends upon any work of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Christ’s, rather to work, as Paul did among the Corinthians
and Thessalonians, than the work and service of their
Lord and Master should be neglected.” pp. 29, 30.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams is said to have published, in London, in
the same year, 1652, a work, entitled, “Experiments of
Spiritual Life and Health, and their Preservatives.” Of
this book, no copy has come to our knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>The only remaining printed book of Mr. Williams, is
his narrative of the dispute with the Quakers. It is entitled,
“George Fox digged out of his Burrowes, or an Offer
of Disputation on fourteen Proposals, made this last Summer,
1672, (so called,) unto G. Fox, then present on
Rhode-Island, in New-England, by R. W. As also how
(G. Fox slily departing) the Disputation went on, being
managed three Days at Newport, on Rhode-Island, and
one day at Providence, between John Stubs, John Burnet,
and William Edmundson, on the one Part, and R. W. on
the other. In which many Quotations out of G. Fox and
Ed. Burrowes’ Book in Folio are alleged. With an Appendix,
of some Scores of G. F. his simple and lame Answers
to his Opposites, in that Book, quoted and replied to,
by R. W. of Providence, in N. E. Boston. Printed by
John Foster, 1676.” It is a small quarto volume, of 327
pages. Its execution is creditable to the American press,
at that early day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The book is dedicated to the King, Charles II. in a courteous
epistle, in which Mr. Williams calls New-England a
“miserable, cold, howling wilderness,” yet says, that God
“hath made it His glory, your Majesty’s glory, and a glory
to the English and Protestant name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There is also an epistle “To the People called Quakers,”
in which the author says, “From my childhood,
(now above threescore years) the Father of Lights and Mercies
touched my soul with a love to himself, to his only-begotten,
the true Lord Jesus, to his Holy Scriptures, &amp;c.
His infinite wisdom hath given me to see the city, court and
country, the schools and universities of my native country,
to converse with some Turks, Jews, Papists, and all sorts
of Protestants, and by books, to know the affairs and religions
of all countries, &amp;c. My conclusion is, that <em>Be of
good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee</em> (Matt. 9) is one of
the joyfullest sounds that ever came to poor sinful ears.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>He says, “I have used some sharp, scripture language,
but not (as commonly you do) passionately and unjustly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He adds a letter “to those many learned and pious men
whom G. Fox hath so sillily and scornfully answered in his
book in folio, especially to those whose names I have been
bold to mention in the Narrative and Appendix, Mr. Richard
Baxter, Mr. John Owen, &amp;c.” In this letter is this
kind and liberal sentence: “As to matters in dispute between
yourselves and me, I willingly omitted them, as
knowing, that many able and honest seamen, in their observations
of this sun (one picture of Christ Jesus) differ
sometimes in their reckonings, though uprightly aiming at,
and bound for, one port and harbor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then follows the main body of the work, containing an
interesting account of the dispute, and a long and tedious
examination of numerous points of doctrine, which Mr.
Fox and his friends maintained. We cannot present an
analysis of the book. It would afford neither profit nor
pleasure. Much of the discussion is a dispute about dark
questions, and many of Mr. Williams’ objections arose,
probably, from the uncouth phraseology with which Mr.
Fox obscured his real meaning. Mr. Williams might
easily misunderstand his opponents, while they insisted so
strongly on the teachings of the inward light, on the formation
of Christ in the soul, and other similar doctrines.
Mr. Fox, too, assumed some positions, which none of the
Friends would now approve. He justified, for example,
the abominable conduct of the females who appeared
naked in the streets, and contended that they acted under
divine inspiration. Mr. Williams said, “You shall never
persuade souls (not bewitched) that the Holy Spirit of God
should persuade your women and maidens to appear in
public streets and assemblies stark naked.” Mr. Fox replied,
“We do believe thee in that dark, persecuting,
bloody spirit that thou and the New-England priests are
bewitched in, you cannot believe, that you are <em>naked</em> from
God, and his clothing, and blind. And therefore hath the
Lord in his power moved some of his sons and daughters
to go naked; yea, and they did tell them, in Oliver’s days,
and the Long Parliament’s, that God would strip them of
their Church profession, and of their power, as naked as
they were. And so they were true prophets and prophetesses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>to the nation, as many sober men have confessed
since, though thou and the old persecuting priests in New-England
remain in your blindness and nakedness.”<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c010'><sup>[382]</sup></a> Mr.
Williams might well abhor Mr. Fox’s principles, if this
had been a fair specimen of their tendency.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams was accused by Mr. Fox and others of advocating
persecution, because he condemned the use of
<em>Thee</em> and <em>Thou</em> to superiors, as uncivil, and declared, that
“a due and moderate restraint and punishing of these incivilities
(though pretending conscience) is as far from
persecution (properly so called) as that it is a duty and
command of God unto all mankind, first in families, and
thence unto all mankind societies.” p. 200. Mr. Williams
did not reason on this point with his usual clearness.
If a man is conscientious about using the terms Thee and
Thou, and wearing his hat, he ought to be allowed to do
so, because these customs do not necessarily interfere with
any other man’s rights. But Mr. Williams viewed them as
offences against civil decorum, and thought that they should
be restrained and punished as such. He cannot, therefore,
be justly accused of inconsistency in relation to his principles
of religious liberty. He probably had in his view the
offensive language, which some of the persons called Quakers
used toward magistrates and others.<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c010'><sup>[383]</sup></a> It is, indeed, a
curious circumstance, that many of the early Quakers
were remarkable for a spirit of bitter railing. Mr. Baxter
says: “The Quakers, in their shops, when I go along London
streets, say, ‘Alas! poor man, thou art yet in darkness.’
They have oft come into the congregation, when I
had liberty to preach Christ’s Gospel, and cried out against
me as a deceiver of the people. They have followed me
home, crying out in the streets, ‘The day of the Lord is
coming, when thou shalt perish as a deceiver.’ They have
stood in the market-place, and under my window year after
year, crying out to the people, ‘Take heed of your priests,
they deceive your souls!’ and if they saw any one wear a
lace or a rich clothing, they cried out to me, ‘These are
the fruit of thy ministry.’”<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c010'><sup>[384]</sup></a> Similar scenes were exhibited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>in this country. There was a remarkable contrast,
at that time, between the language and the general
demeanor of the Quakers. They used no force, and made
no resistance, but they uttered, without stint, the most virulent
epithets. It might seem, that they had literally
adopted the counsel of Minerva to Achilles—not to unsheathe
the sword, but to reproach their adversaries with
words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μηδὲ ξιφος ἕλκεο χειρί,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀλλ’ ήτοι έπεσιν μεν ονειδισον.</span>”<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c010'><sup>[385]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams, in writing his book, caught some of the
same spirit, and used a style of contemptuous bitterness,
which was not natural to him. Mr. Fox and Mr. Burnyeat
replied in the same strain, though with more coarseness.
Their book is a quarto, of 489 pages. It is entitled,
“A New-England Firebrand Quenched,” &amp;c.
They filled twenty-four pages with words and phrases
culled from Mr. Williams’ book, with this preface: “A
catalogue of R. W’s. envious, malicious, scornful, railing
stuff, false accusations and blasphemies, which he foully
and unchristianlike hath scattered and dispersed through
his book.” At the end are two letters, the one from Mr.
Coddington, and the other from Mr. Richard Scott, in
both of which Mr. Williams is spoken of with much harshness.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we have done with these books. It would be well,
for the reputation of all the parties, if they could be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have thus reviewed all the printed books of Mr.
Williams, of which we have been able to obtain copies.
Two or three treatises, which he wrote, were not, it is presumed,
printed. Among these, was the essay concerning
the patent, which excited the displeasure of the magistrates
in Massachusetts, before his banishment.<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c010'><sup>[386]</sup></a> At the end of
his Key, he says, “I have further treated of these natives
of New-England, and that great point of their conversion,
in a little additional discourse to this.” This discourse
we have never seen. In the letter to Governor Bradstreet,
(page 353 of this volume) Mr. Williams speaks of a collection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>of heads of discourses preached to the “scattered
English at Narraganset,” and which Mr. Williams requests
the Governor to assist him in printing. It does
not appear that it was printed. Dr. Holmes, (Annals, vol.
i. p. 411) says, “In the Prince Collection of MSS. are
heads of discourses, which he delivered to the Narraganset
Indians.” An ineffectual search has been made among
the MSS. referred to, for these heads of discourses, which
may have been mislaid. They may be the same as those
mentioned in the letter to Governor Bradstreet.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is said to be a MS. of one hundred and six quarto
pages, in the library of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
entitled, “Esau and Jacob’s Mystical Harmony,” &amp;c. written
in 1666, with a memorandum in Dr. Stiles’ hand writing,
“I suppose Roger Williams.” We have not had
an opportunity to examine this manuscript.</p>

<p class='c009'>The letters of Mr. Williams were very numerous. He
held an extensive correspondence. Many of these letters
are preserved, and many others are referred to, which
have perished.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the character of Mr. Williams, as a writer, those who
have read the letters and extracts from his books, contained
in this volume, can form a judgment. His style is very
original and characteristic. It is the outpouring of a full
and ardent mind, too intent on the thought, to be very
careful of the expression. It is, consequently, not always
correct; but it is always clear and forcible. He exhibits
ample learning, and quotations from the classics are scattered
through his writings, in an easy and natural manner.
He was very familiar with the Scriptures, which he read
in the original languages; though he, like most theological
writers of that time, was imperfectly acquainted with the
laws of interpretation. He had a very active imagination,
and his style is full of figures, always striking, and often
happy, but not uniformly selected and applied, with a pure
taste. This liveliness of his fancy made him fond of puns
and quaint expressions, which he used, however, with no
design to amuse the reader, but to illustrate and enforce
his meaning. He had, indeed, a poetical mind, and some
passages of his works remind us of the magnificent periods
of Milton and Taylor. The specimens of his verses in his
Key, though superior to much of the contemporary rhyme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>contained in Morton’s Memorial and Mather’s Magnalia,
are inferior, in real poetic feeling and expression, to some
paragraphs of his prose works. He was one of those poets
mentioned by Wordsworth,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“That are sown</div>
      <div class='line'>By nature; men endowed with highest gifts,</div>
      <div class='line'>The vision and the faculty divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet wanting the accomplishment of verse.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>His writings, in short, like those of all great minds,
are a reflection of his own character, and are marked with
his excellencies and his faults.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must now close this book with a few observations
concerning his character. It is unnecessary to dwell minutely
on this point, for no man was ever more transparent;
and those who have traced his history, have had ample
means of forming their own judgment.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mental faculties were of a high order. His mind
was strong, original and independent. The clearness with
which he discerned the true principles of religious liberty,
and the steadiness with which he maintained them, in
opposition to the general theory and practice of that
age, show a superior intellect. Few men are far in advance
of their contemporaries; and this is a wise arrangement
of Providence, for such men are not so immediately
useful, as many others of inferior powers. They are not
understood—they offend the prejudices, and wound the
self-love of men. Their influence is of the nature of prophecy.
They plant principles, which are of slow growth,
but which will eventually produce rich fruit. Such individuals
must be content to live for posterity. They must
be steadfast in upholding the truth, though amid ingratitude
and opposition, cheered by the bright prospect of
future triumph.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Williams was of this class of men, and his station
in that class is a proof of the elevation and vigor of his
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is an evidence, also, of superior moral qualities. It
requires a spirit of self-sacrifice, a pure love of truth, a
benevolent zeal for the welfare of mankind, an elevation
above selfish ends. All these traits of character Mr. Williams
possessed. He was sincerely pious. Love to God
dwelt habitually in his soul, and controlled his feelings and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>his actions. In his books and letters, every topic takes a
hue from his piety. His magnanimous forgiveness of injuries,
his zeal for the welfare of all who sought his aid, his
untiring benevolence towards the hapless savages, his patriotic
and self-denying toils for the prosperity of his colony,
all show the efficacy and fervor of those religious principles
which governed him. Mr. Callender said of him,
“Mr. Williams appears, by the whole course and tenor of
his life and conduct here, to have been one of the most
disinterested men that ever lived, a most pious and heavenly
minded soul.”<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c010'><sup>[387]</sup></a> Dr. Bentley says: “In Salem, every
person loved Mr. Williams. He had no personal enemies,
under any pretence. All valued his friendship. Kind
treatment could win him, but opposition could not conquer
him. He was not afraid to stand alone for truth against
the world, and he had address enough with his firmness,
never to be forsaken by the friends he had ever gained.
He had always a tenderness of conscience, and feared
every offence against moral truth. He breathed the purest
devotion. He was a friend of human nature, forgiving,
upright and pious. He understood the Indians better than
any man of his age. He made not so many converts, but
he made more sincere friends.”<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c010'><sup>[388]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>His religious principles were those of Calvin. His views
of the ordinances of the Gospel were, undoubtedly, after
his baptism, those now held by the Baptists. But he did
not acknowledge himself as belonging to any denomination;
because he believed, that there are now neither true
churches, nor persons authorized to administer the ordinances.</p>

<p class='c009'>His political principles were decidedly in favor of the
rights of the people. He not only displayed them, in the
civil constitution of his colony, but he repeatedly stated
them in his books. Such passages as the following contain
his political creed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kings and magistrates must be considered invested
with no more power than the people betrust them with.”
“The sovereign power of all civil authority is founded in
the consent of the people.”<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c010'><sup>[389]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>The faults of Mr. Williams sprung, in part, from the imperfection
of human nature, and in part from his temperament
and the constitution of his mind. He was ardent,
and his imagination was the most active of his intellectual
faculties. He sometimes adopted opinions, rather by a
sudden bound of the imagination, than by a regular process
of reasoning. His ardor, and his conscientious and
fearless love of truth, impelled him to act on his opinions,
with a degree of energy and firmness which exposed him
to the charge of obstinacy. Such a man will occasionally
fall into error, and into rapid transitions, which will give
to his conduct the appearance of inconsistency. This was
the case with Mr. Williams, in some of his actions, but the
inconsistency never affected his great principles. These
he never abandoned for a moment. His course was steadily
onward, like that of a planet, though disturbing causes occasionally
produced slight eccentricities.</p>

<p class='c009'>In his domestic relations, he seems to have been amiable
and happy. His expressions of attachment to his family
prove the strength of his conjugal and parental affection.
His children grew up to maturity. A numerous posterity
have arisen to bless his memory, and to feel pleasure in
the contemplation of his character and the diffusion of his
fame.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is dead, but his principles survive, and are destined
to spread over the earth. The State which he founded is
his monument.<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c010'><sup>[390]</sup></a> Her sons, when asked for a record of
Roger Williams, may point to her history, unstained by a
single act of persecution; to her prosperity, her perfect
freedom, her tranquil happiness, and may reply, in the
spirit of the epitaph on the tomb of Sir Christopher Wren,
in St. Paul’s Cathedral, “<em>look around!</em>”</p>

<h3 class='c022'><span class='sc'>Note A.</span> p. 23.</h3>

<p class='c023'>On the subject of the relationship between Cromwell and Roger
Williams, an obliging antiquarian friend says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“As to the relationship between Mr. Williams and Oliver Cromwell,
I can only say, that it was quite remote, if it existed at all.
In the London Review, for March, 1772, is a genealogy of the
Cromwell family. As you may not have seen this account, and as
it may interest you, I will give you an abridgment of it, that you
may see how near related he was to the Protector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The genealogy was extracted from Welch chronicles, about the
year 1602, to show the descent of Sir Henry Cromwell, who was
then living. It commences in the person of Glothyan, fifth Lord
of Powes, who married Morpeth, daughter and heiress of Edwin ap
Tydwall, Lord of Cardigan, who was lineally descended from Cavedig,
of whom the county of Cardigan took the name of Cavedigion.
His son, Gwaith Voyd, was Lord of Cardigan, Powes, Gwayte and
Gwaynesaye. He died about 1066.</p>

<p class='c009'>“From Gwynstan ap Gwaith, second son of the above Gwaith
Voyd, was lineally descended, through about thirteen generations,
or in about four hundred and forty years, Morgan Williams, who, in
the reign of Henry VIII., married the sister of Thomas Cromwell.
This Morgan Williams had a son Richard, who was knighted by
Henry VIII., not by the name of Williams, but by the name of
Cromwell, after his uncle, whose heir he became. This Sir Richard
had a son Henry, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1563,
and married Joan, daughter of Sir Ralph Warren, and had six sons
and four daughters. The sons were Oliver, Robert, Henry, Richard,
Philip and Ralph. Oliver, the Protector, was the only son of Robert,
and born in the parish of St. John, in Huntingdon, April 25,
1599.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The above will satisfy us, that the tradition in the family of their
being a connection by blood with the Protector, may be true. You
will see, however, that the connection was quite remote.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Concerning the parents of Mr. Williams, I have discovered nothing.
The name “Roger Williams” occurs in Welsh genealogies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>but without any clue to guide us. I have written to Wales for information,
but have received no reply. A brother of Mr. Williams,
named Robert, was one of the early inhabitants of Providence, and
was afterwards a schoolmaster in Newport. He mentions, in one of
his books, another brother, “a Turkey merchant.” Richard Williams,
who settled in Taunton, has been supposed to have been a
brother of Roger.</p>

<h3 class='c022'><span class='sc'>Note B.</span> p. 54.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Our note respecting the Anabaptists must be brief. An Anabaptist
is one who baptizes again a person previously baptized. The
Cathari, of the third century, were accustomed to baptize again
those who joined them from other sects.—Murdock’s Mosheim, vol.
i. p. 247. The name was early applied to those who opposed infant
baptism, and who baptized those who joined them, though they had
been baptized in infancy. The name, of course, expressed the
views of their opponents, and not their own, because they did not
consider such persons as having been baptized.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the history of the Anabaptists, (retaining this name for the
sake of convenience,) we cannot now speak. The odium and alarm
which are alluded to in the text, arose from the disturbances that
occurred in Germany, about the year 1535. It would be tedious to
narrate these events; but it may be stated, briefly, that the peasants,
oppressed by their feudal lords, made a desperate effort to obtain
their freedom. Among them were some Anabaptists, mingled with
Lutherans, Catholics and others. They obtained possession of the
city of Munster, in Westphalia, and held it about three years; but
they were finally overpowered, and the war terminated, after immense
slaughter. It seems to have been a just revolt, and a struggle
for liberty; but it failed, and the leaders have been stigmatized
as fanatics, and as guilty of every species of crime. The story has
been told by their oppressors and enemies, and it is entitled to very
little credit. Mosheim seems to have been unable to find words to
express his abhorrence of the Anabaptists, to whom he imputes most
of the disorders of the Rustic War. Other writers are more candid.
Benedict (vol. i. pp. 246, 265) has vindicated the Baptists from the
charges which have been alleged against them in connection with
that war. Admitting that very dangerous doctrines were then
avowed, and wrong actions committed, it is unjust to make the
Baptists of England and America responsible for them. It would
be as fair, to impute to Pedobaptists all the atrocities of the Papal
church. It is sufficient for our present purpose, to prove, that the
English and American Baptists have never held the principles
which have been ascribed to the Anabaptists of Germany. The rejection
of magistracy has been the most prominent charge. A company
of persons, called Anabaptists, in London, published a Confession
of Faith, about the year 1611, in which they say: “The
office of the magistrate is a permissive ordinance of God.” And in
the following article, they anticipated the doctrines of Roger Williams:
“The magistrate is not to meddle with religion, or matters
of conscience, nor to compel men to this or that form of religion;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>because Christ is the King or Lawgiver of the church and conscience.”—Crosby,
vol. i. p. 71, appendix. In a “Confession of
Faith of seven congregations, or churches of Christ, in London,
which are commonly, but unjustly, called Anabaptists,” published
in 1646, they say: “A civil magistracy is an ordinance of God, set
up by him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of
them that do well; and that in all lawful things, commanded by
them, subjection ought to be given by us in the Lord, not only for
wrath, but for conscience sake; and that we are to make supplications
and prayers for kings, and for all that are in authority, that
under them we may live a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness
and honesty.”—Crosby, vol. i. appendix, p. 23. These extracts express
the doctrines of the English Baptist churches on the point in
question. The principles of Roger Williams, respecting religious and
civil duties, are sufficiently exhibited in the Memoir. They are the
principles of the American Baptist churches, and have been so from
the beginning. In the Confession of Faith of the First Baptist
Church in Boston, founded in 1665, and the oldest church in what
was then the colony of Massachusetts, the church say: “We acknowledge
magistracy to be an ordinance of God, and to submit
ourselves to them in the Lord, not because of wrath only, but for
conscience sake.”—Winchell’s Historical Discourses, p. 10.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The occasion, I confess, is sorrowful, because I see yourselves,
with others, embarked in a resolution to invade and despoil your
poor countrymen, in a wilderness, and your ancient friends, of our
temporal and soul liberties.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is sorrowful, also, because mine eye beholds a black and
doleful train of grievous, and, I fear, bloody consequences, at the
heel of this business, both to you and us. The Lord is righteous in
all our afflictions, that is a maxim; the Lord is gracious to all oppressed,
that is another; he is most gracious to the soul that cries
and waits on him: that is silver, tried in the fire seven times.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir, I am not out of hopes, but that while your aged eyes and
mine are yet in their orbs, and not yet sunk down into their holes
of rottenness, we shall leave our friends and countrymen, our children
and relations, and this land, in peace, behind us. To this end,
Sir, please you with a calm and steady and a Christian hand, to
hold the balance and to weigh these few considerations, in much
love and due respect presented:</p>

<p class='c016'>“First. When I was unkindly and unchristianly, as I believe,
driven from my house and land and wife and children, (in the
midst of a New-England winter, now about thirty-five years past,)
at Salem, that ever-honored Governor, Mr. Winthrop, privately
wrote to me to steer my course to the Narraganset Bay and Indians,
for many high and heavenly and public ends, encouraging me, from
the freeness of the place from any English claims or patents. I
took his prudent motion as a hint and voice from God, and waving
all other thoughts and motions, I steered my course from Salem
(though in winter snow, which I feel yet) unto these parts, wherein
I may say Peniel, that is, I have seen the face of God.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Second. I first pitched, and begun to build and plant at Seekonk,
now Rehoboth, but I received a letter from my ancient friend, Mr.
Winslow, then Governor of Plymouth, professing his own and others’
love and respect to me, yet lovingly advising me, since I was fallen
into the edge of their bounds, and they were loth to displease the
Bay, to remove but to the other side of the water, and then, he said,
I had the country free before me, and might be as free as themselves,
and we should be loving neighbors together. These were
the joint understandings of these two eminently wise and Christian
Governors and others, in their day, together with their counsel and
advice as to the freedom and vacancy of this place, which in this
respect, and many other Providences of the Most Holy and Only
Wise, I called <em>Providence</em>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Third. Sometime after, the Plymouth great sachem, (Ousamaquin<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c010'><sup>[392]</sup></a>)
upon occasion, affirming that Providence was his land, and
therefore Plymouth’s land, and some resenting it, the then prudent
and godly Governor, Mr. Bradford, and others of his godly council,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>answered, that if, after due examination, it should be found true
what the barbarian said, yet having, to my loss of a harvest that
year, been now (though by their gentle advice) as good as banished
from Plymouth as from the Massachusetts, and I had quietly and
patiently departed from them, at their motion, to the place where
now I was, I should not be molested and tossed up and down again,
while they had breath in their bodies; and surely, between those,
my friends of the Bay and Plymouth, I was sorely tossed, for one
fourteen weeks, in a bitter winter season, not knowing what bread
of bed did mean, beside the yearly loss of no small matter in my
trading with English and natives, being debarred from Boston, the
chief mart and port of New-England. God knows that many
thousand pounds cannot repay the very temporary losses I have
sustained. It lies upon the Massachusetts and me, yea, and other
colonies joining with them, to examine, with fear and trembling,
before the eyes of flaming fire, the true cause of all my sorrows and
sufferings. It pleased the Father of spirits to touch many hearts,
dear to him, with some relentings; amongst which, that great and
pious soul, Mr. Winslow, melted, and kindly visited me, at Providence,
and put a piece of gold into the hands of my wife, for our
supply.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Fourth. When, the next year after my banishment, the Lord
drew the bow of the Pequod war against the country, in which, Sir,
the Lord made yourself, with others, a blessed instrument of peace
to all New-England, I had my share of service to the whole land in
that Pequod business, inferior to very few that acted, for,</p>

<p class='c016'>“1. Upon letters received from the Governor and Council at
Boston, requesting me to use my utmost and speediest endeavors to
break and hinder the league labored for by the Pequods against the
Mohegans, and Pequods against the English, (excusing the not
sending of company and supplies, by the haste of the business,) the
Lord helped me immediately to put my life into my hand, and,
scarce acquainting my wife, to ship myself, all alone, in a poor
canoe, and to cut through a stormy wind, with great seas, every
minute in hazard of life, to the sachem’s house.</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. Three days and nights my business forced me to lodge and
mix with the bloody Pequod ambassadors, whose hands and arms, methought,
wreaked with the blood of my countrymen, murdered and
massacred by them on Connecticut river, and from whom I could
not but nightly look for their bloody knives at my own throat also.</p>

<p class='c016'>“3. When God wondrously preserved me, and helped me to
break to pieces the Pequods’ negotiation and design, and to make,
and promote and finish, by many travels and charges, the English
league with the Narragansets and Mohegans against the Pequods,
and that the English forces marched up to the Narraganset country
against the Pequods, I gladly entertained, at my house in Providence,
the General Stoughton and his officers, and used my utmost
care that all his officers and soldiers should be well accommodated
with us.</p>

<p class='c016'>“4. I marched up with them to the Narraganset sachems, and
brought my countrymen and the barbarians, sachems and captains,
to a mutual confidence and complacence, each in other.</p>

<p class='c016'>“5. Though I was ready to have marched further, yet, upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>agreement that I should keep at Providence, as an agent between
the Bay and the army, I returned, and was interpreter and intelligencer,
constantly receiving and sending letters to the Governor
and Council at Boston, &amp;c., in which work I judge it no impertinent
digression to recite (out of the many scores of letters, at times,
from Mr. Winthrop,) this one pious and heavenly prophecy, touching
all New-England, of that gallant man, viz: “If the Lord turn
away his face from our sins, and bless our endeavors and yours, at
this time, against our bloody enemy, we and our children shall long
enjoy peace, in this, our wilderness condition.” And himself and
some other of the Council motioned, and it was debated, whether or
no I had not merited, not only to be recalled from banishment, but
also to be honored with some remark of favor. It is known who
hindered, who never promoted the liberty of other men’s consciences.
These things, and ten times more, I could relate, to show
that I am not a stranger to the Pequod wars and lands, and possibly
not far from the merit of a foot of land in either country, which I
have not.</p>

<p class='c016'>“5. Considering (upon frequent exceptions against Providence
men) that we had no authority for civil government, I went purposely
to England, and upon my report and petition, the Parliament
granted us a charter of government for these parts, so judged
vacant on all hands. And upon this, the country about us was
more friendly, and wrote to us, and treated us as an authorized
colony; only the difference of our consciences much obstructed.
The bounds of this, our first charter, I (having occular knowledge
of persons, places and transactions) did honestly and conscientiously,
as in the holy presence of God, draw up from Pawcatuck
river, which I then believed, and still do, is free from all English
claims and conquests; for although there were some Pequods on
this side the river, who, by reason of some sachems’ marriages with
some on this side, lived in a kind of neutrality with both sides, yet,
upon the breaking out of the war, they relinquished their land to
the possession of their enemies, the Narragansets and Nianticks,
and their land never came into the condition of the lands on the
other side, which the English, by conquest, challenged; so that I
must still affirm, as in God’s holy presence, I tenderly waved to
touch a foot of land in which I knew the Pequod wars were maintained
and were properly Pequod, being a gallant country; and
from Pawcatuck river hitherward, being but a patch of ground, full
of troublesome inhabitants, I did, as I judged, inoffensively, draw
our poor and inconsiderable line.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is true, when at Portsmouth, on Rhode-Island, some of ours,
in a General Assembly, motioned their planting on this side Pawcatuck.
I, hearing that some of the Massachusetts reckoned this land
theirs, by conquest, dissuaded from the motion, until the matter
should be amicably debated and composed; for though I questioned
not our right, &amp;c., yet I feared it would be inexpedient and offensive,
and procreative of these heats and fires, to the dishonoring
of the King’s Majesty, and the dishonoring and blaspheming of
God and of religion in the eyes of the English and barbarians
about us.</p>

<p class='c016'>“6. Some time after the Pequod war and our charter from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Parliament, the government of Massachusetts wrote to myself (then
chief officer in this colony) of their receiving of a patent from the
Parliament for these vacant lands, as an addition to the Massachusetts,
&amp;c., and thereupon requesting me to exercise no more authority,
&amp;c., for, they wrote, their charter was granted some few
weeks before ours. I returned, what I believed righteous and
weighty, to the hands of my true friend, Mr. Winthrop, the first
mover of my coming into these parts, and to that answer of mine I
never received the least reply; only it is certain, that, at Mr. Gorton’s
complaint against the Massachusetts, the Lord High Admiral,
President, said, openly, in a full meeting of the commissioners, that
he knew no other charter for these parts than what Mr. Williams
had obtained, and he was sure that charter, which the Massachusetts
Englishmen pretended, had never passed the table.</p>

<p class='c016'>“7. Upon our humble address, by our agent, Mr. Clarke, to his
Majesty, and his gracious promise of renewing our former charter,
Mr. Winthrop, upon some mistake, had entrenched upon our line,
and not only so, but, as it is said, upon the lines of other charters
also. Upon Mr. Clarke’s complaint, your grant was called in again,
and it had never been returned, but upon a report that the agents,
Mr. Winthrop and Mr. Clarke, were agreed, by mediation of friends,
(and it is true, they came to a solemn agreement, under hands and
seals,) which agreement was never violated on our part.</p>

<p class='c016'>“8. But the King’s Majesty sending his commissioners (among
other of his royal purposes) to reconcile the differences of, and to
settle the bounds between the colonies, yourselves know how the
King himself therefore hath given a decision to this controversy.
Accordingly, the King’s Majesty’s aforesaid commissioners at Rhode
Island, (where, as a commissioner for this colony, I transacted with
them, as did also commissioners from Plymouth,) they composed a
controversy between Plymouth and us, and settled the bounds between
us, in which we rest.</p>

<p class='c016'>“9. However you satisfy yourselves with the Pequod conquest;
with the sealing of your charter some few weeks before ours; with
the complaints of particular men to your colony; yet, upon a due
and serious examination of the matter, in the sight of God, you will
find the business at bottom to be,</p>

<p class='c016'>“First, a depraved appetite after the great vanities, dreams and
shadows of this vanishing life, great portions of land, land in this
wilderness, as if men were in as great necessity and danger for want
of great portions of land, as poor, hungry, thirsty seamen have, after
a sick and stormy, a long and starving passage. This is one of the
gods of New-England, which the living and most high Eternal will
destroy and famish.</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. An unneighborly and unchristian intrusion upon us, as being
the weaker, contrary to your laws, as well as ours, concerning purchasing
of lands without the consent of the General Court. This I
told Major Atherton, at his first going up to the Narraganset about
this business. I refused all their proffers of land, and refused to interpret
for them to the sachems.</p>

<p class='c016'>“3. From these violations and intrusions arise the complaint of
many privateers, not dealing as they would be dealt with, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>to law of nature, the law of the prophets and Christ Jesus, complaining
against others, in a design, when they themselves are delinquents
and wrong doers. I could aggravate this many ways with Scripture
rhetoric and similitudes, but I see need of anodynes, (as physicians
speak,) and not of irritations. Only this I must crave leave to say,
that it looks like a prodigy or monster, that countrymen among savages
in a wilderness; that professors of God and one Mediator, of an
eternal life, and that this is like a dream, should not be content with
those vast and large tracts which all the other colonies have, (like
platters and tables full of dainties,) but pull and snatch away their
poor neighbors’ bit or crust; and a crust it is, and a dry, hard one,
too, because of the natives’ continual troubles, trials and vexations.</p>

<p class='c016'>“10. Alas! Sir, in calm midnight thoughts, what are these leaves
and flowers, and smoke and shadows, and dreams of earthly nothings,
about which we poor fools and children, as David saith, disquiet ourselves
in vain? Alas! what is all the scuffling of this world for,
but, <em>come, will you smoke it</em>? What are all the contentions and wars
of this world about, generally, but for greater dishes and bowls of
porridge, of which, if we believe God’s Spirit in Scripture, Esau and
Jacob were types? Esau will part with the heavenly birthright for
his supping, after his hunting, for god belly; and Jacob will part
with his porridge for an eternal inheritance. O Lord, give me to
make Jacob’s and Mary’s choice, which shall never be taken from
me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“11. How much sweeter is the counsel of the Son of God, to mind
first the matters of his kingdom; to take no care for to-morrow; to
pluck out, cut off and fling away right eyes, hands and feet, rather
than to be cast whole into hell-fire; to consider the ravens and the
lilies whom a heavenly Father so clothes and feeds; and the counsel
of his servant Paul, to roll our cares, for this life also, upon the
most high Lord, steward of his people, the eternal God; to be content
with food and raiment; to mind not our own, but every man the
things of another; yea, and to suffer wrong, and part with what we
judge is right, yea, our lives and (as poor women martyrs have said)
as many as there be hairs upon our heads, for the name of God and
the son of God his sake. This is humanity, yea this is Christianity.
The rest is but formality and picture, courteous idolatry and Jewish
and Popish blasphemy against the Christian religion, the Father of
spirits and his Son, the Lord Jesus. Besides, Sir, the matter with us
is not about these children’s toys of land, meadows, cattle, government,
&amp;c. But here, all over this colony, a great number of weak
and distressed souls, scattered, are flying hither from Old and New-England,
the Most High and Only Wise hath, in his infinite wisdom,
provided this country and this corner as a shelter for the poor and
persecuted, according to their several persuasions. And thus that
heavenly man, Mr. Haynes, Governor of Connecticut, though he
pronounced the sentence of my long banishment against me, at
Cambridge, then Newtown, yet said unto me, in his own house at
Hartford, being then in some difference with the Bay: “I think,
Mr. Williams, I must now confess to you, that the most wise God
hath provided and cut out this part of his world for a refuge and receptacle
for all sorts of consciences. I am now under a cloud, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>my brother Hooker; with the Bay, as you have been, we have removed
from them thus far, and yet they are not satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Thus, Sir, the King’s Majesty, though his father’s and his own
conscience favored Lord Bishops, which their father and grandfather
King James, whom I have spoke with, sore against his will, also did,
yet all the world may see, by his Majesty’s declarations and engagements
before his return, and his declarations and Parliament speeches
since, and many suitable actings, how the Father of spirits hath
mightily impressed and touched his royal spirit, though the Bishops
much disturbed him, with deep inclination of favor and gentleness
to different consciences and apprehensions as to the invisible King
and way of his worship. Hence he hath vouchsafed his royal
promise under his hand and broad seal, that no person in this colony
shall be molested or questioned for the matters of his conscience to
God, so he be loyal and keep the civil peace. Sir, we must part
with lands and lives before we part with such a jewel. I judge you
may yield some land and the government of it to us, and we, for
peace sake, the like to you, as being but subjects to one king, &amp;c.
and I think the King’s Majesty would thank us, for many reasons.
But to part with this jewel, we may as soon do it as the Jews with
the favor of Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes. Yourselves pretend
liberty of conscience, but alas! it is but self, the great god self, only
to yourselves. The King’s Majesty winks at Barbadoes, where
Jews and all sorts of Christian and Antichristian persuasions are
free, but our grant, some few weeks after yours sealed, though granted
as soon, if not before yours, is crowned with the King’s extraordinary
favor to this colony, as being a banished one, in which his
Majesty declared himself that he would experiment, whether civil
government could consist with such liberty of conscience. This
his Majesty’s grant was startled at by his Majesty’s high officers of
state, who were to view it in course before the sealing, but fearing
the lion’s roaring, they couched, against their wills, in obedience to
his Majesty’s pleasure.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Some of yours, as I heard lately, told tales to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, viz. that we are a profane people, and do not keep the
Sabbath, but some do plough, &amp;c. But, first, you told him not how
we suffer freely all other persuasions, yea the common prayer,
which yourselves will not suffer. If you say you will, you confess
you must suffer more, as we do.</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. You know this is but a color to your design, for, first, you
know that all England itself (after the formality and superstition of
morning and evening prayer) play away their Sabbath. 2d. You
know yourselves do not keep the Sabbath, that is the seventh day,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c016'>“3. You know that famous Calvin and thousands more held it but
ceremonial and figurative, from Colossians 2, &amp;c. and vanished; and
that the day of worship was alterable at the churches’ pleasure.
Thus also all the Romanists confess, saying, viz. that there is no express
scripture, first, for infants’ baptisms; nor, second, for abolishing
the seventh day, and instituting of the eighth day worship, but
that it is at the churches’ pleasure.</p>

<p class='c016'>“4. You know, that generally, all this whole colony observe the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>first day, only here and there one out of conscience, another out of
covetousness, make no conscience of it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“5. You know the greatest part of the world make no conscience
of a seventh day. The next part of the world, Turks, Jews and
Christians, keep three different days, Friday, Saturday, Sunday for
their Sabbath and day of worship, and every one maintains his own
by the longest sword.</p>

<p class='c016'>“6. I have offered, and do, by these presents, to discuss by disputation,
writing or printing, among other points of differences, these
three positions; first, that forced worship stinks in God’s nostrils.
2d. That it denies Christ Jesus yet to be come, and makes the
church yet national, figurative and ceremonial. 3d. That in these
flames about religion, as his Majesty, his father and grandfather have
yielded, there is no other prudent, Christian way of preserving
peace in the world, but by permission of differing consciences. Accordingly,
I do now offer to dispute these points and other points of
difference, if you please, at Hartford, Boston and Plymouth. For
the manner of the dispute and the discussion, if you think fit, one
whole day each month in summer, at each place, by course, I am
ready, if the Lord permit, and, as I humbly hope, assist me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is said, that you intend not to invade our spiritual or civil liberties,
but only (under the advantage of first sealing your charter) to
right the privateers that petition to you. It is said, also, that if you
had but Mishquomacuck and Narraganset lands quietly yielded, you
would stop at Coweset, &amp;c. Oh, Sir, what do these thoughts
preach, but that private cabins rule all, whatever become of the ship
of common safety and religion, which is so much pretended in New-England?
Sir, I have heard further, and by some that say they
know, that something deeper than all which hath been mentioned
lies in the three colonies’ breasts and consultations. I judge it not fit
to commit such matter to the trust of paper, &amp;c. but only beseech
the Father of spirits to guide our poor bewildered spirits, for his
name and mercy sake.</p>

<p class='c016'>“15. Whereas our case seems to be the case of Paul appealing to
Cæsar against the plots of his religious, zealous adversaries, I hear
you pass not of our petitions and appeals to his Majesty, for partly
you think the King will not own a profane people that do not keep
the Sabbath; partly you think that the King incompetent judge,
but you will force him to law also, to confirm your first-born Esau,
though Jacob had him by the heels, and in God’s holy time must
carry the birthright and inheritance. I judge your surmise is a dangerous
mistake, for patents, grants and charters, and such like royal
favors, are not laws of England, and acts of Parliament, nor matters
of propriety and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuum</span></i> between the King and his subjects,
which, as the times have been, have been sometimes triable in inferior
Courts; but such kind of grants have been like high offices in
England, of high honor, and ten, yea twenty thousand pounds gain
per annum, yet revocable or curtable upon pleasure, according to the
King’s better information, or upon his Majesty’s sight, or misbehavior,
ingratefulness, or designs fraudulently plotted, private and distinct
from him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“16. Sir, I lament that such designs should be carried on at such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>a time, while we are stript and whipt, and are still under (the whole
country) the dreadful rods of God, in our wheat, hay, corn, cattle,
shipping, trading, bodies and lives; when, on the other side of the
water, all sorts of consciences (yours and ours) are frying in the
Bishops’ pan and furnace; when the French and Romish Jesuits, the
firebrands of the world for their god belly sake, are kindling at our
back, in this country, especially with the Mohawks and Mohegans,
against us, of which I know and have daily information.</p>

<p class='c016'>“17. If any please to say, is there no medicine for this malady?
Must the nakedness of New-England, like some notorious strumpet,
be prostituted to the blaspheming eyes of all nations? Must we be
put to plead before his Majesty, and consequently the Lord Bishops,
our common enemies, &amp;c. I answer, the Father of mercies and
God of all consolations hath graciously discovered to me, as I believe,
a remedy, which, if taken, will quiet all minds, yours and
ours, will keep yours and ours in quiet possession and enjoyment of
their lands, which you all have so dearly bought and purchased in
this barbarous country, and so long possessed amongst these wild
savages; will preserve you both in the liberties and honors of your
charters and governments, without the least impeachment of yielding
one to another; with a strong curb also to those wild barbarians
and all the barbarians of this country, without troubling of compromisers
and arbitrators between you; without any delay, or long
and chargeable and grievous address to our King’s Majesty, whose
gentle and serene soul must needs be afflicted to be troubled again
with us. If you please to ask me what my prescription is, I will not
put you off to Christian moderation or Christian humility, or Christian
prudence, or Christian love, or Christian self-denial, or Christian
contention or patience. For I design a civil, a humane and political
medicine, which, if the God of Heaven please to bless, you
will find it effectual to all the ends I have proposed. Only I must
crave your pardon, both parties of you, if I judge it not fit to discover
it at present. I know you are both of you hot; I fear myself,
also. If both desire, in a loving and calm spirit, to enjoy your
rights, I promise you, with God’s help, to help you to them, in a fair
and sweet and easy way. My receipt will not please you all. If it
should so please God to frown upon us that you should not like it, I
can but humbly mourn, and say with the prophet, that which must
perish must perish. And as to myself, in endeavoring after your
temporal and spiritual peace, I humbly desire to say, if I perish, I
perish. It is but a shadow vanished, a bubble broke, a dream finished.
Eternity will pay for all.</p>

the experience of your wonted loving-kindness and gentleness toward
all men and myself also, I pray you hear me patiently. I had
proposed to have personally attended this Court, and to have presented,
myself, these few requests following, but being much lamed
and broken with such travels, I am forced to present you in writing
these five requests. The first four concern others living and dead
amongst us; the fifth, concerns myself.</p>

<p class='c016'>“First, then, I pray be pleased to review the propositions between
us and our dead friend, John Smith; and since it hath pleased the
God of all mercies, to vouchsafe this town and others such a mercy,
by his means, I beseech you study how to put an end to that controversy
depending between us and him, (as I may so speak) and
his; ’tis true, you have referred that business to some of our loving
neighbors amongst you; but since there are some obstructions, I
beseech you put forth your wisdoms, who know more ways to the
wood than one. Ease the first, and appoint others, or some other
course, that the dead clamor not from his grave against us, but that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>the country about us may say, that Providence is not only a wise,
but a grateful people to the God of mercies, and all his instruments
of mercy towards us.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My second request concerns the dead still. I understand, that
one of the orphans of our dead friend, Daniel Abbott, is likely (as
she herself told me) to be disposed of in marriage. ’Tis true she is
now come to some years, but who knows not what need the poor maid
hath of your fatherly care, counsel and direction. I would not disparage
the young man (for I hear he hath been laborious) yet with
your leave, I might say, I doubt not you will not give your daughters
in marriage to such, whose lives have been in such a course,
without some good assurance and certificate of his not being engaged
to other women, or otherways criminous, as also of his resolution
to forsake his former course, lest (this inquiry being neglected)
the maid and ourselves repent when misery hath befallen her,
and a just reproof and charges befall ourselves, of which we have
no need.</p>

<p class='c016'>“For, thirdly, I crave your consideration of that lamentable object
(what shall I say, of all our censure or pity, I am sure) of all our
wonder and astonishment, Mrs. Weston. My experience of the
distempers of persons elsewhere, makes me confident, that although
not in all things, yet in a great measure, she is a distracted woman.
My request is, that you would be pleased to take what is left of
hers into your own hands, and appoint some to order it for her supply,
and if it may be, let some public act of mercy to her necessities,
stand upon record amongst the merciful acts of a merciful town,
that hath received many mercies from heaven, and remember that
we know not how soon our wives may be widows, and our children
orphans, yea, and ourselves be deprived of all or most of our reason,
before we go from hence, except mercy from the God of mercies
prevent it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Fourthly. Let me crave your patience, while once more I lead
your consideration to the grave, amongst the dead, the widows and
the fatherless. From some neighbors and the widow Mann herself,
I understand, that notwithstanding her motherly affection,
which will make all burthens lighter for her children’s good, yet
she is not without fears, that if the town be not favorable to her in
after times, some hard measure and pressures may befall her. My
request is, therefore, that it would please you to appoint some of
yourselves to review the will, and to consider whether the pains of
the father, deceased, or want of time, hath not occasioned him to
leave some of his purposes and desires imperfect, as also to propose
to the town wherein, according to the rules of justice and mercy,
what the deceased intended, may be perfected, for the greater comfort
both of his widow and orphans.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Fifth. My last request concerns myself. I cannot be so unthankful
to you, and so insensible of mine own and family’s comfort, as
not to take notice of your continued and constant love and care in
your many public and solemn orders for the payment of that money
due unto me about the charter: ’tis true I have never demanded it;
yea, I have been truly desirous that it might have been laid out for
some further public benefit in each town, but observing your loving
resolution to the contrary, I have at last resolved to write unto you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>(as I have also lately done to Portsmouth and Newport) about the
better ordering it to my advantage. I have here (through God’s
providence) convenience of improving some goats; my request is,
therefore, that if it may be without much trouble, you would please
to order the payment of it in cattle of that kind. I have been
solicited and have promised my help, about iron works, when the
matter is ripe, earnestly desirous every way to further the good of
the town of Providence, to which I am so much engaged, and to
yourselves the loving inhabitants thereof, to whom I desire to be</p>

from you and to send to you since this storm arose. The report was
(as most commonly all Indian reports are) absolutely false, of my
removing my goods, or the least rag, &amp;c. A fortnight since, I heard
of the Mohawks coming to Pawcatuck, their rendezvous; that they
were provoked by Uncas’ wronging and robbing some Pawcatuck
Indians the last year, and that he had dared the Mohawks, threatening,
if they came, to set his ground with gobbets of their flesh; that
our neighbors had given them play, (as they do every year;) yet
withal I heard they were divided; some resolved to proceed, others
pleaded their hunting season. We have here one Waupinhommin,
a proud, desperate abuser of us, and a firebrand to stir up the natives
against us, who makes it all his trade to run between the Mohawks
and these, and (being a captain also himself) renders the Mohawks
more terrible and powerful than the English. Between him and
the chief sachems hath been great consultations, and to my knowledge,
he hath persuaded them to desert their country and become
one rebellious body or rout with the Mohawks, and so to defy the
English, &amp;c. I have sent also what I can inform to the commissioners.
At present, (through mercy) we are in peace.</p>

your late meetings, that (studying my quietness) I thought fit to
present you with these few lines. Two words I pray you to consider.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>First, as to this plantation of Providence: then as to some new
plantation, if it shall please the same God of mercies who provided
this, to provide another in mercy for us. 1. As to this town, although
I have been called out, of late, to declare my understanding as to
the bounds of Providence and Pawtuxet; and, although divers have
lands and meadows in possession beyond these bounds, yet I hope
that none of you think me so senseless as to put on any barbarian
to molest an Englishman, or to demand a farthing of any of
you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. If any do (as formerly some have done, and divers have given
gratuities, as Mr. Field, about Notaquoncanot and others,) I promise,
that as I have been assistant to satisfy and pacify the natives
round about us, so I hope I shall still while I live be helpful to any
of you that may have occasion to use me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, as to some new plantation, I desire to propose that which
may quench contention, may accommodate such who want, and
may also return monies unto such as have of late disbursed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To this purpose, I desire that we be patient, and torment not
ourselves and the natives, (sachems and people,) putting them upon
mischievous remedies, with the great noise of twenty miles new or
old purchase.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let us consider, if Niswosakit and Wayunckeke, and the land
thereabout, may not afford a new and comfortable plantation, which
we may go through with an effectual endeavor for true public good.
To this end, I pray you consider, that the inhabitants of these parts,
with most of the Coweset and Nipmucks, have long since forsaken
the Narraganset sachems and subjected themselves to the Massachusetts.
And yet they are free to sell their lands to any whom
the Massachusetts shall not protest against. To this end (observing
their often flights, and to stop their running to the Massachusetts)
I have parlied with them, and find that about thirty pounds will
cause them to leave those parts, and yield peaceable possession. I
suppose, then, that the town may do well to give leave to about
twenty of your inhabitants (of which I offer to be one, and know
others willing) to lay down thirty shillings a man toward the purchase.
Let every one of this number have liberty to remove himself,
or to place a child or friend there. Let every person who shall
afterward be received into the purchase lay down thirty shillings,
as hath been done in Providence, which may be paid (by some order
agreed on) to such as lately have disbursed monies unto the effecting
of this. I offer, gratis, my time and pains, in hope that such as
want may have a comfortable supply amongst us, and others made
room for, who may be glad of shelter also.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>“1. I testify and declare, in the holy presence of God, that when
at my first coming into these parts, I obtained the lands of Seekonk
of Ousamaquin, the then chief sachem on that side, the Governor
of Plymouth (Mr. Winslow) wrote to me, in the name of their government,
their claim of Seekonk to be in their jurisdiction, as also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>their advice to remove but over the river unto this side, (where
now, by God’s merciful providence, we are,) and then I should be
out of their claim, and be as free as themselves, and loving neighbors
together.</p>

<p class='c016'>“2. After I had obtained this place, now called Providence, of
Canonicus and Miantinomo, the chief Narraganset sachems deceased,
Ousamaquin, the sachem aforesaid, also deceased, laid his claim
to this place also. This forced me to repair to the Narraganset
sachems aforesaid, who declared that Ousamaquin was their subject,
and had solemnly himself, in person, with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, subjected himself
and his lands unto them at the Narraganset: only now he
seemed to revolt from his loyalties under the shelter of the English
at Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c016'>“3. This I declared from the Narraganset sachems to Ousamaquin,
who, without any stick, acknowledged it to be true that he had
so subjected as the Narraganset sachems affirmed; but withal, he affirmed
that he was not subdued by war, which himself and his father
had maintained against the Narragansets, but God, said he, subdued
me by a plague, which swept away my people, and forced me to
yield.</p>

<p class='c016'>“4. This conviction and confession of his, together with gratuities
to himself and brethren and followers, made him often profess,
that he was pleased that I should here be his neighbor, and that
rather because he and I had been great friends at Plymouth, and
also because that his and my friends at Plymouth advised him to be
at peace and friendship with me, and he hoped that our children
after us would be good friends together.</p>

<p class='c016'>“5. And whereas, there hath been often spread of Providence
falling within Plymouth jurisdiction, by virtue of Ousamaquin’s
claims, I add unto the testimony abovesaid, that the Governor, Mr.
Bradford, and other of their magistrates, declared unto me, both by
conference and writing, that they and their government were satisfied,
and resolved never to molest Providence, nor to claim beyond
Seekonk, but to continue loving friends and neighbors (amongst the
barbarians) together.</p>

<p class='c016'>“This is the true sum and substance of many passages between
our countrymen of Plymouth and Ousamaquin and me.</p>

<p class='c016'>“With my humble and loving respects to yourself and other honored
friends, &amp;c. I thought fit to tell you what the providence of
the Most High hath brought to my hand the evening before yesterday.
Two Indian children were brought to me by one Thomas
Clements, who had his house burnt on the other side of the river.
He was in his orchard, and two Indian children came boldly to him,
the boy being about seven or eight, and the girl (his sister) three or
four years old. The boy tells me, that a youth, one Mittonan, brought
them to the sight of Thomas Clements, and bid them go to that man,
and he would give them bread. He saith his father and mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>were taken by the Pequods and Mohegans about ten weeks ago, as
they were clamming (with many more Indians) at Coweset; that their
dwelling was and is at a place called Mittaubscut; that it is upon a
branch of Pawtuxet river, to Coweset (their nearest salt water) about
seven or eight miles; that there are about twenty houses. I cannot
learn of him that there are above twenty men, beside women and children;
that they live on ground-nuts, &amp;c. and deer; that Aawaysewaukit
is their sachem; and twelve days ago he sent his son, Wunnawmeneeskat,
to Uncas, with a present of a basket or two of wampum.
I know this sachem is much related to Plymouth, to whom
he is said to be subject, but he said, (as all of them do) [he] deposited
his land. I know what bargains he made with the Browns and
Willets and Rhode-Island and Providence men, and the controversies
between the Narragansets and them, about those lands. I know
the talk abroad of the right of the three united colonies (by conquest)
to this land, and the plea of Rhode-Island by the charter and commissioners.
I humbly desire that this party may be brought in; the
country improved (if God in mercy so please;) the English not differ
about it and complaints run to the King (to unknown trouble, charge
and hazard, &amp;c.) and therefore I humbly beg of God that a committee
from the four colonies may (by way of prudent and godly wisdom)
prevent many inconveniences and mischiefs. I write the sum
of this to the Governors of Connecticut and Rhode-Island, and
humbly beg of the Father of mercies to guide you in mercy, for his
mercy sake.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My humble respects presented, with congratulations and prayers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>to the Most High, for your merciful preservations in and through
these late bloody and burning times, the peaceable travelling and
assembling amongst the ruins and rubbish of these late desolations,
which the Most High hath justly brought upon us. I crave your
gently leave to tell you, that I humbly conceive I am called of God
to present your wisdoms with what light I can, to make your difficulties
and travails the easier. I am sore grieved that a self-seeking
contentious soul, who has long afflicted this town and colony, should
now, with his unseasonable and unjust clamor, afflict our Royal Sovereign,
his honorable Council, New and Old England, and now
your honored selves, with these his contentious courses. For myself,
it hath pleased God to vouchsafe me knowledge and experience
of his providences in these parts, so that I should be ungratefully
and treacherously silent at such a time. When his Majesty’s Commissioners,
Col. Nichols, &amp;c. were here, I was chosen by this colony,
one of the commissioners to treat with them and with the commissioners
from Plymouth, who then were their honored Governor deceased,
and honored present Governor, about our bounds. It then
pleased the Father of mercies, in whose most high and holy hands
the hearts of all men are, to give me such favor in their eyes, that
afterward, at a great assembly at Warwick, where (that firebrand)
Philip, his whole country, was challenged by the Narraganset
sachems, I was sent for, and declared such transactions between old
Canonicus and Ousamaquin, that the commissioners were satisfied,
and confirmed unto the ungrateful monster his country. The Narraganset
sachems (prompted by some English) told the commissioners,
that Mr. Williams was but one witness, but the commissioners
answered that they had such experience of my knowledge in these
parts, and fidelity, that they valued my testimony as much as twenty
witnesses.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Among so many passages since W. Har. (so long ago) kindled
the fires of contention, give me leave to trouble you with one, when
if W. H. had any desire by equal and peaceable converse with men,
this fire had been quenched; our General Court, Mishauntatuk men
and W. Har. agreed that arbitration should heal this old sore. Arbitrators
were chosen, and Mr. Thomas Willet was chosen umpire.
He, when they met, told them that the arbitrators should consider
every plea with equity, and allot to every one what the arbitrators’
consciences told them was right and equal. Mishauntatuk men
yielded, W. Carpenter, then one with W. Har., yielded. W. Har.
cried out no; he was resolved, all or none; so the honored soul, Mr.
Willet (as he himself told me) could not proceed, but was forced to
draw up a protest to acquit himself and the arbitrators from this trust,
that the obstruction might only be laid on W. Har. his shoulders,
concerning whom a volume might be written, of his furious, covetous,
and contentious domineering over his poor neighbors. I have
presented a character of him to his Majesty, (in defence of myself
against him) in my narrative against George Fox, printed at Boston.
I think it not seasonable here to trouble your patience with particulars
as to the matter. I humbly refer myself to my large testimony,
given in writing, at a Court of Trials on the Island, before the honored
gentleman, deceased, Mr. W. Brenton, then Governor. At the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>time Mr. William Arnold, father to our honored present Governor,
and Stukely Westcott, father to our Governor’s wife, gave in their
testimony with mine, and W. Har. was cast. In that testimony, I
declare not only how unrighteous, but also how simple is W. Harris
his ground of pleading, viz. after Miantinomo had set us our bounds
here in his own person, because of the envious clamors of some
against myself, one amongst us (not I) recorded a testimony or
memorandum of a courtesy added (upon request) by the sachem, in
these words, <em>up stream without limits</em>. The courtesy was requested and
granted, that being shortened in bounds by the sachem because of
the Indians about us, it might be no offence if our few cows fed up
the rivers where nobody dwelt, and home again at night. This
hasty, unadvised memorandum W. H. interprets of bounds set to our
town by the sachems; but he would set no bounds to our cattle, but
up the streams so far as they branched or run, so far all the meadows,
and at last all the uplands, must be drawn into this accidental courtesy,
and yet, upon no consideration given, nor the sachem’s knowledge
or hand, nor witnesses, nor date, nor for what term of time
this kindness should continue.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Second. In my testimony, I have declared that Miantinomo having
set such short bounds (because of the Indians) upon my motion,
payments were given by us to Alexander and Philip, and the Narraganset
sachems, near two hundred and fifty pounds, in their pay,
for inland enlargements, according to leave granted us by the
General Court upon our petition. This after purchase and satisfaction
to all claimers, W. Harris puts a rotten title upon it, and calls
it confirmation, a confirmation of the title and grant of <em>up streams
without limits</em>; but all the sachems and Indians, when they heard of
such an interpretation, they cried <em>commoobin</em>, lying and stealing, as
such a cheat as stunk in their pagan nostrils.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Honored Sirs, let me now add to my testimony, a list of several

about part of which, Will. Harris contending with them, it is said,
was the first occasion of W. Har. falling in love with this his
monstrous Diana <em>up streams without limits</em>, that so he might antedate
and prevent (as he speaks) the blades of Warwick.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sixteenth. The town of Providence, by virtue of Canonicus’
and Miantinomo’s grant renewed to me again and again, viz. of as
large a plantation and accommodation as any town in the country
of New-England. It is known what favor God pleased to give me
with old Canonicus, (though at a dear-bought rate) so that I had
what I would (so that I observed my times of moderation;) but two
or three envious and ungrateful souls among us cried out, What is
R. Williams? We will have the sachem come and set our bounds
for us; which he did, and (because of his Indians round about us)
so sudden and so short, that we were forced to petition to our General
Court for enlargement.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Honored Sirs, there be other claims, and therefore I presume
your wisdoms will send forth your proclamations to all the colonies,
that all the claims may come in before your next meeting; and Oh
that it would please the Most High to move the colonies’ hearts to
empower you, and move your hearts to be willing, (being honorably
rewarded) and the hearts of the claimers to acquiesce and rest in
your determination. And Oh let not the colonies of Connecticut
and Rhode-Island to be offended, if I humbly beseech them, for
God’s sake, for the King’s sake, for the country of New-England’s
sake, and for their own souls’ and selves’ and posterity’s sakes, to
prevent any more complaints and clamors to the King’s Majesty,
and agree to submit their differences to the wisdoms of such solemn
commissioners chosen out of the whole country. I know there are
objections, but also know that love to God, love to the country and
posterity, will conquer greater matters, and I believe the King’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>Majesty, himself, will give us thanks for sparing him and his honorable
Council from being troubled with us.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Honored gentlemen, if his Majesty and honorable Council knew
how against all law of England, Wm. Harris thus affects New and
Old England, viz. that a vast country should be purchased, and yet
be but a poor courtesy from one sachem, who understood no such
thing, nor they that begged it of him, who had not, nor asked any
consideration for it, who was not desired to set his hand to it, nor
did; nor are there the hands of witnesses, but the parties themselves,
nor no date, nor term of time, for the use of feeding
cows, up streams without limits, and yet these words, (<em>up streams
without limits</em>) by a sudden and unwary hand so written, must be
the ground of W. Har. this raising a fire about these thirty years
unquenchable. If his Majesty and Council knew how many of
his good subjects are claimers and competitors to these lands and
meadows up the streams of Pawtuxet and Pawtucket, though only one
comes thus clamoring to him, to cheat all the rest. If his Majesty
and Council knew this confirmation W. H. talks of, what a grand
cheat it is, stinking in the nostrils of all Indians, who subscribed to
and only confirmed only such bounds as were formerly given us,
and W. Harris clamors that they confirmed Miantinomo’s grant of
up streams without limits, a thing which they abhor to hear of, and
(amongst others) was one great occasion of their late great burning
and slaughtering of us.”&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I testify, as in the presence of the all-making and all-seeing
God, that about fifty years since, I coming into this Narraganset
country, I found a great contest between three sachems, two (to wit,
Canonicus and Miantinomo) were against Ousamaquin, on Plymouth
side, I was forced to travel between them three, to pacify, to
satisfy all their and their dependents’ spirits of my honest intentions
to live peaceably by them. I testify, that it was the general and
constant declaration, that Canonicus his father had three sons,
whereof Canonicus was the heir, and his youngest brother’s son,
Miantinomo, (because of youth,) was his marshal and executioner,
and did nothing without his uncle Canonicus’ consent; and therefore
I declare to posterity, that were it not for the favor God gave
me with Canonicus, none of these parts, no, not Rhode-Island, had
been purchased or obtained, for I never got any thing out of Canonicus
but by gift. I also profess, that, very inquisitive of what
the title or denomination Narraganset should come, I heard that
Narraganset was so named from a little island between Puttiquomscut
and Musquomacuk on the sea and fresh water side. I went on
purpose to see it; and about the place called Sugar-Loaf Hill, I
saw it, and was within a pole of it, but could not learn why it was
called Narraganset. I had learnt, that the Massachusetts was
called so, from the Blue Hills, a little island thereabout; and Canonicus’
father and ancestors, living in those southern parts, transferred
and brought their authority and name into those northern
parts, all along by the sea-side, as appears by the great destruction
of wood all along near the sea-side; and I desire posterity to see
the gracious hand of the Most High, (in whose hands are all hearts)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>that when the hearts of my countrymen and friends and brethren
failed me, his infinite wisdom and merits stirred up the barbarous
heart of Canonicus to love me as his son to his last gasp, by which
means I had not only Miantinomo and all the lowest sachems my
friends, but Ousamaquin also, who, because of my great friendship
with him at Plymouth, and the authority of Canonicus, consented
freely, being also well gratified by me, to the Governor Winthrop
and my enjoyment of Prudence, yea of Providence itself, and all
the other lands I procured of Canonicus which were upon the
point, and in effect whatsoever I desired of him; and I never denied
him or Miantinomo whatever they desired of me as to goods or
gifts or use of my boats or pinnace, and the travels of my own person,
day and night, which, though men know not, nor care to know,
yet the all-seeing Eye hath seen it, and his all-powerful hand hath
helped me. Blessed be his holy name to eternity.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“We, Robert Coles, Chad Browne, William Harris, and John
Warren, being freely chosen by the consent of our loving friends
and neighbors, the inhabitants of this town of Providence, having
many differences amongst us, they being freely willing, and also
bound themselves to stand to our arbitration, in all differences
amongst us, to rest contented in our determination, being so betrusted,
we have seriously and carefully endeavored to weigh and
consider all these differences, being desirous to bring to unity and
peace, although our abilities are far short in the due examination of
such weighty things, yet so far as we conceive in laying all things
together, we have gone the fairest and the equallest way to produce
our peace.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I. Agreed. We have, with one consent, agreed, that in the
parting those particular proprieties which some of our friends and
neighbors have in Pawtuxet from the general common of our town
of Providence, to run upon a straight line upon a fresh spring, being
in the gully at the head of that cove, running by that point of
land called Sassafras, unto the town of Mashapaug, to an oak tree
standing near unto the corn-field, being at this time the nearest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>corn-field unto Pawtuxet, the oak tree having four marks with an
axe, till some other landmark be set for a certain bound. Also we
agree, that if any meadow ground lying and joining to that meadow
that borders upon the river of Pawtuxet, come within the aforesaid
line, which will not come within a straight line from long cove
to the marked tree, then for that meadow to belong to Pawtuxet,
and so beyond the town of Mashapaug from the oak tree between
the two fresh rivers Pawtuxet and Wanasquatucket, of an even
distance.</p>

<p class='c016'>“II. Agreed. We have with one consent agreed that for the disposing
of those lands that shall be disposed, belonging to this town of
Providence, to be in the whole inhabitants by the choice of five men
for general disposal, to be betrusted with disposal of lands and also
of the town’s stock, and all general things, and not to receive in
any in six days as townsmen, but first to give the inhabitants notice
to consider if any have just cause to show against the receiving of
him, as you can apprehend, and to receive none but such as subscribe
to this our determination. Also we agree, that if any of our
neighbors do apprehend himself wronged by these or any of these
five disposers, that at the general town meeting he may have a
trial.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Also, we agree for the town to choose, beside the other five
men, one or more to keep record of all things belonging to the town
and lying in common.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We agree, as formerly hath been the liberties of the town, so
still to hold forth liberty of conscience.</p>

<p class='c016'>“III. Agreed, that after many considerations and consultations
of our own State and also of other States abroad, in way of government,
we apprehend no way so suitable to our condition as government
by way of arbitration. But if men agree themselves by arbitration,
no State we know of disallows that, neither do we. But if
men refuse that which is but common humanity between man and
man, then to compel such unreasonable persons to a reasonable way,
we agree that the five disposers shall have power to compel him
either to choose two men himself, or if he refuse, for them to choose
two men to arbitrate his cause, and if these four men chosen by
every party do end the cause, then to see their determination performed,
and the faultive to pay the arbitrators for their time spent
in it. But if these four men do not end it, then for the five disposers
to choose three men to put an end to it. And for the certainty
hereof we agree the major part of the five disposers to choose the
three men, and the major part of the three men to end the cause,
having power from the five disposers, by a note under their hand,
to perform it; and the faultive not agreeing in the first to pay the
charge of the last, and for the arbitrators to follow no employment
until the cause be ended, without consent of the whole that have
to do with the cause.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Instance. In the first arbitration, the offender may offer reasonable
terms of peace, and the offended may exact upon him, and
refuse and trouble men beyond reasonable satisfaction; so for the
last arbitrators to judge where the fault was, in not agreeing in the
first, to pay the charge in the last.</p>

<p class='c016'>“IV. Agreed, that if any person damnify any man, either in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>goods or good name, and the person offended follow not the cause
upon the offender, that if any person give notice to the five disposers,
they shall call the party delinquent to answer by arbitration.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Instance. Thus, if any person abuse another in person or
goods, may be for peace sake a man will at present put it up, and it
may so be resolve to revenge: therefore, for the peace of the State,
the disposers are to look to it in the first place.</p>

<p class='c016'>“V. Agreed, for all the whole inhabitants to combine ourselves
to assist any man in the pursuit of any party delinquent, with all
our best endeavors to attack him; but if any man raise a hubbub,
and there be no just cause, then for the party that raised the hubbub
to satisfy men for their time lost in it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“VI. Agreed, that if any man have a difference with any of the
five, then he may have the clerk call the town together at his
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a trial.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Instance. It may be a man may be to depart the land, or to a
far part of the land, or his estate may lie upon a speedy trial, or the
like case may fall out.</p>

<p class='c016'>“VII. Agreed, that the town, by five men, shall give every man
a deed of all his lands lying within the bounds of the plantation to
hold it by for after ages.</p>

<p class='c016'>“VIII. Agreed, that the five disposers shall, from the date hereof,
meet every month day upon general things, and at the quarter
day to yield a new choice, and give up their old accounts.</p>

<p class='c016'>“IX. Agreed, that the clerk shall call the five disposers together
at the month day, and the general town together every quarter, to
meet upon general occasions, from the date hereof.</p>

<p class='c016'>“X. Agreed, that the clerk is to receive for every cause that
comes to the town for a trial, 4<em>d.</em>; for making each deed, 12<em>d.</em>; and
to give up the book to the town at the year’s end, and yield to a
new choice.</p>

<p class='c016'>“XI. Agreed, that all acts of disposal on both sides &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to stand
since the difference.</p>

<p class='c016'>“XII. Agreed, that every man who hath not paid in his purchase
money for his plantation, shall make up his 10<em>s.</em> to be 30<em>s.</em> equal
with the first purchases; and for all that are received townsmen
hereafter to pay the like sum of money to the town stock.</p>

our peace, we desiring our loving friends to receive as our absolute
determination, laying ourselves down as subject to it.”</p>

<p class='c023'><em>The first Charter, copied from 2 His. Coll. ix. pp. 185–8.</em></p>

<p class='c016'>“Whereas, by an ordinance of the Lords and Commons, now assembled
in Parliament, bearing date the second day of November,
Anno Domini 1643, Robert, Earl of Warwick, is constituted, and
ordained governor in chief, and lord high admiral of all those islands
and other plantations inhabited or planted by, or belonging to any
his Majesty the King of England’s subjects, (or which hereafter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>may be inhabited and planted by, or belong to them) within the
bounds, and upon the coasts of America:</p>

<p class='c016'>“And whereas the said Lords have thought fit and thereby ordained
that Philip Earl of Pembroke, Edward Earl of Manchester, William
Viscount, Say and Seal, Philip Lord Wharton, John Lord Rolle,
members of the House of Peers; Sir Gilbert Gerrard, Baronet, Sir
Arthur Haslerig, Baronet, Sir Henry Vane, jr. Knight, Sir Benjamin
Rudyard, Knight, John Pym, Oliver Cromwell, Dennis Bond,
Miles Corbet, Cornelius Holland, Samuel Vassal, John Rolle, and
William Spurstow, Esqrs. members of the House of Commons,
should be commissioners to join in aid and assistance with the said
Earl. And whereas, for the better government and defence, it is
thereby ordained, that the aforesaid governor and commissioners, or
the greater number of them, shall have power, and authority, from
time to time, to nominate, appoint, and constitute all such subordinate
governors, counsellors, commanders, officers, and agents, as
they shall judge to be best affected, and most fit, and serviceable for
the said islands and plantations; and to provide for, order and dispose
all things, which they shall, from time to time, find most advantageous
for the said plantations: and for the better security of the owners
and inhabitants thereof, to assign, ratify, and confirm, so much of
their aforementioned authority and power, and in such manner,
and to such persons, as they shall judge to be fit for the better governing
and preserving of the said plantations and islands, from open
violences and private disturbances and distractions. And whereas
there is a tract of land in the continent of America aforesaid, called
by the name of Narraganset Bay, bordering northward and northeast
on the patent of Massachusetts, east and southeast on Plymouth
patent, south on the ocean, and on the west and northwest by the
Indians called Nahigganneucks, alias Narragansets, the whole tract
extending about twenty-five English miles, unto the Pequod river
and country.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And whereas, well affected and industrious English inhabitants,
of the towns of Providence, Portsmouth and Newport, in the tract
aforesaid, have adventured to make a nearer neighborhood and
society with the great body of the Narragansets, which may, in time,
by the blessing of God upon their endeavors, lay a sure foundation
of happiness to all America; and have also purchased, and are
purchasing of and amongst the natives, some other places, which
may be convenient, both for plantations, and also for building of
ships, supply of pipe staves, and other merchandise.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And whereas the said English have represented their desire to
the said Earl, and commissioners, to have their hopeful beginnings
approved and confirmed, by granting unto them a free charter of
civil incorporation and government; that they may order and govern
their plantation in such a manner, as to maintain justice and
peace, both among themselves, and towards all men with whom
they shall have to do. In due consideration of the said premises,
the said Robert, Earl of Warwick, governor in chief, and lord high
admiral of the said plantations, and the greater number of the said
commissioners, whose names and seals are hereunder written and
subjoined, out of a desire to encourage the good beginnings of the
said planters, do, by the authority of the aforesaid ordinance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>Lords and Commons, give, grant, and confirm, to the aforesaid inhabitants
of the towns of Providence, Portsmouth and Newport, a
free and absolute charter of incorporation, to be known by the name
of <em>The Incorporation of Providence Plantation, in the Narraganset
Bay, in New-England</em>. Together with full power and authority,
to rule themselves, and such others as shall hereafter inhabit within
any part of the said tract of land, by such a form of civil government,
as by voluntary consent of all, or the greater part of them,
they shall find most suitable to their estate and condition; and, for
that end, to make and ordain such civil laws and constitutions, and
to inflict such punishments upon transgressors, and for execution
thereof, so to place, and displace officers of justice, as they, or the
greatest part of them, shall by free consent agree unto. <em>Provided</em>,
<em>nevertheless</em>, that the said laws, constitutions, and punishments, for
the civil government of the said plantations, be conformable to the
laws of England, so far as the nature and constitution of the place
will admit. And always reserving to the said Earl, and commissioners,
and their successors, power and authority for to dispose
the general government of that, as it stands in relation to the rest
of the plantations in America, as they shall conceive, from time to
time, most conducing to the general good of the said plantations,
the honor of his Majesty, and the service of the State. And the
said Earl and commissioners do further authorize, that the aforesaid
inhabitants, for the better transacting of their public affairs, to make
and use a public seal, as the known seal of the Providence Plantations,
in the Narraganset Bay, in New-England. In testimony
whereof, the said Robert, Earl of Warwick, and commissioners, have
hereunto set their hands and seals, the fourteenth day of March, in
the nineteenth year of our sovereign lord King Charles, and in the
year of our Lord God, 1643.</p>

16th of the 3d mo. 1647, to appear for us, at the General Court of
this colony, to be held at Portsmouth, on Rhode-Island, upon the
18th of this inst. month, desiring the Lord’s providence for your

full power and authority as followeth: First, to act and vote for us

affairs, and for the settling of the island in peace and union, and
for all matters that shall concern this particular town, desiring a
careful respect unto these ensuing instructions. But, if the Court
shall consist of ten of each town, then our desires are, that this our
commission, with the ensuing instructions, may remain entire in
your hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First. That we may have a true copy of our charter assigned
unto us by the General Court, for the proper use of our plantation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Secondly. We do voluntarily and are freely willing to receive
and be governed by the laws of England, together with the way of
administration of them, so far as the nature and constitution of this
plantation will admit, desiring, so far as possibly may be, to hold a
correspondency with the whole colony in that model that hath been

General Court shall complete and confirm the same, or any other

ordain, authorize and confirm, all our particular town officers, and
also that the said officers shall be responsible unto our particular
town, and that there may be no intermixture of general and particular
officers, but that all may know their bounds and limits.</p>

appeals unto General Courts, that so, if any shall be justly grieved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>at any sentence passed or otherwise, he or they may make their
lawful charge for relief there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lastly. Whereas, it was hinted in that which our worthy

authority unto the said inhabitants to govern themselves and such
others as shall come among them, as also to make, constitute and

requisite; therefore, upon the petition and humble request of the

of General Assembly, wherein they desire freedom and liberty
to incorporate themselves into a body politic, and we, the said Assembly,

<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>transgressors, and for execution thereof, and of the common statute
laws of the colony, agreed unto, and the penalties, and so many of
them as are not annexed already unto the colony Court of Trials, so
to place and displace officers of justice, as they, or the greater part
of them, shall, by one consent, agree unto. Provided, nevertheless,
that the said laws, constitutions, and punishments, for the civil government
of the said Plantation, be conformable to the laws of England,
so far as the nature and constitution of the place will admit,
yet always reserving to the aforesaid General Assembly, power and
authority so to dispose the general government of that plantation,
as it stands in reference to the rest of the plantation, as they shall
conceive, from time to time, most conducing to the general good of
the said plantation. And we, the said Assembly, do further authorize
the aforesaid inhabitants to elect and engage such aforesaid officers
upon the first second day of June annually. And moreover, we
authorize the said inhabitants, for the better transacting of their public
affairs, to make and use a public seal, as the known seal of Providence
Plantation, in the Narraganset Bay, in New-England. In
testimony whereof, we, the said General Assembly, have hereunto
set our hands and seal, the 14th of March, Anno 1648.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Charles the Second, by the grace of God, &amp;c., to all to whom
these presents shall come, greeting: Whereas we have been informed,
by the petition of our trusty and well-beloved subjects, John
Clarke, on the behalf of Benedict Arnold, William Brenton, William
Coddington, Nicholas Easton, William Boulston, John Porter,
John Smith, Samuel Gorton, John Weekes, Roger Williams, Thomas
Olney, Gregory Dexter, John Coggeshall, Joseph Clarke, Randall
Houlden, John Greene, John Roome, Samuel Wildbore, William
Field, James Barker, Richard Tew, Thomas Harris, and William
Dyre, and the rest of the purchasers and free inhabitants of our
island, called Rhode-Island, and the rest of the colony of Providence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>Plantations, in the Narraganset Bay, in New-England, in America:
That they, pursuing with peace and loyal minds their sober, serious
and religious intentions, of godly edifying themselves and one
another in the holy Christian faith and worship, as they were persuaded,
together with the gaining over and conversion of the poor
ignorant Indian natives, in those parts of America, to the sincere
profession and obedience of the same faith and worship, did not
only, by the consent and good encouragement of our royal progenitors,
transport themselves out of this kingdom of England, into
America; but also, since their arrival there, after their first settlement
amongst other of our subjects in those parts, for the avoiding
of discord, and these many evils which were likely to ensue upon
those, our subjects, not being able to bear, in those remote parts,
their different apprehensions in religious concernments: and in
pursuance of the aforesaid ends, did once again leave their desirable
stations and habitations, and, with excessive labor and travail, hazard
and charge, did transplant themselves into the midst of the Indian
natives, who, as we are informed, are the most potent princes and
people of all that country; where, by the good providences of God
(from whom the plantations have taken their name) upon their labor
and industry, they have not only been preserved to admiration, but
have increased and prospered, and are seized and possessed, by
purchase and consent of said natives, to their full content, of such
lands, islands, rivers, harbors, and roads, as are very convenient,
both for plantations and also for building of ships, supplying of pipe-staves
and other merchandise, which lie very commodious, in many
respects, for commerce, and to accommodate our southern plantations,
and may much advance the trade of this our realm, and greatly
enlarge the territories thereof; they having, by near neighborhood
to, and friendly society with, the great body of Narraganset Indians,
given them encouragement, of their own accord, to subject themselves,
their people and land unto us; whereby, as is hoped, there
may, in time, by the blessing of God upon their endeavors, be laid
a sure foundation of happiness to all America:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And whereas, in their humble address, they have freely declared,
that it is much on their hearts (if they be permitted) to hold
forth a lively experiment, that a most flourishing civil state may
stand, and best be maintained, and that among our English subjects,
with a full liberty in religious concernments; and that true piety,
rightly grounded upon Gospel principles, will give the best and
greatest security to sovereignty, and will lay in the hearts of men
the strongest obligations to true loyalty:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now know ye, that we, being willing to encourage the hopeful
undertaking of our said loyal and loving subjects, and to secure
them in the free exercise and enjoyment of all the civil and religious
rights appertaining to them, as our loving subjects, and to
preserve unto them that liberty in the true Christian faith and
worship of God, which they have sought, with so much travail, and
with peaceable minds and loyal subjection to our royal progenitors
and ourselves, to enjoy; and because some of the people and inhabitants
of the same colony cannot, in their private opinion, conform
to the public exercise of religion, according to the liturgy,
form and ceremonies of the Church of England, to take or subscribe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>the oaths and articles made and established in that behalf; and for
that the same, by reason of the remote distances of those places, will,
as we hope, be no breach of the unity and uniformity established in
this nation, have therefore thought fit, and do hereby publish, grant,
ordain, and declare, that our royal will and pleasure is:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That no person, within the said colony, at any time hereafter,
shall be anywise molested, punished, disquieted, or called in question,
for any differences in opinion in matters of religion, who do not
actually disturb the civil peace of our said colony; but that all and
every person and persons may, from time to time, and at all times
hereafter, freely and fully have and enjoy his own and their judgments
and consciences, in matters of religious concernments, throughout
the tract of land hereafter mentioned, they behaving themselves
peaceably and quietly, and not using this liberty to licentiousness
and profaneness, nor to the civil injury or outward disturbance of
others; any law, statute, or clause therein contained, or to be contained,
usage, or custom of this realm, to the contrary hereof, in anywise
notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And that they may be in the better capacity to defend themselves,
in their just rights and liberties, against all the enemies of
the Christian faith, and others, in all respects, we have further
thought fit, and at the humble petition of the persons aforesaid, are
graciously pleased to declare,</p>

<p class='c009'>“That they shall have and enjoy the benefit of our late act of indemnity
and free pardon, as the rest of our subjects in our other
dominions and territories have, and to create or make them a body
politic or corporate, with the powers and privileges hereinafter mentioned.
And, accordingly, our will and pleasure is, and of our
especial grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion, we have ordained,
constituted, and declared, and, by these presents, for us, our
heirs, and successors, do ordain, constitute, and declare, that they,
the said William Brenton, William Coddington, Nicholas Easton,
Benedict Arnold, William Boulston, John Porter, Samuel Gorton,
John Smith, John Weekes, Roger Williams, Thomas Olney, Gregory
Dexter, John Coggeshall, Joseph Clarke, Randall Houlden, John
Greene, John Roome, William Dyre, Samuel Wildbore, Richard
Tew, William Field, Thomas Harris, James Barker, —— Rainsborrow,
—— Williams, and John Nickson, and all such others as
are now, or hereafter shall be, admitted free of the company and
society of our colony of Providence Plantations, in the Narraganset
Bay, in New-England, shall be, from time to time, and forever hereafter,
a body corporate and politic, in fact and name, by the name of
<em>The Governor and Company of the English Colony of Rhode-Island
and Providence Plantations, in New-England, in America</em>; and that by
the same name they and their successors shall and may have perpetual
succession, and shall and may be persons able and capable in
the law to sue and be sued, to plead and be impleaded, to answer
and to be answered unto, to defend and to be defended, in all and
singular suits, causes, quarrels, matters, actions, and things, of what
kind or nature soever; and also to have, take, possess, acquire, and
purchase lands, tenements, or hereditaments, or any goods or chattels,
and the same to lease, grant, demise, alien, bargain, sell, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>dispose of, at their own will and pleasure, as other our liege people
of this our realm of England, or any corporation or body politic within
the same, may lawfully do.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And further, that they, the said Governor and company, and their
successors, shall and may, forever hereafter, have a common seal, to
serve and use for all matters, causes, things, and affairs whatsoever,
of them and their successors: and the same seal to alter, change,
break, and make new, from time to time, at their will and pleasure,
as they shall think fit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And further, we will and ordain, and, by these presents, for us,
our heirs and successors, declare and appoint, that, for the better
ordering and managing of the affairs and business of the said company
and their successors, there shall be one Governor, one Deputy
Governor, and ten Assistants, to be from time to time constituted,
elected and chosen, out of the freemen of the said company, for the
time being, in such manner and form as is hereafter in these presents
expressed; which said officers shall apply themselves to take care
for the best disposing and ordering of the general business and affairs
of and concerning the lands and hereditaments hereinafter mentioned
to be granted, and the plantation thereof, and the government of the
people there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, for the better execution of our royal pleasure herein, we do,
for us, our heirs and successors, assign, name, constitute, and appoint
the aforesaid Benedict Arnold to be the first and present Governor
of the said company, and the said William Brenton to be the
Deputy Governor; and the said William Boulston, John Porter,
Roger Williams, Thomas Olney, John Smith, John Greene, John
Coggeshall, James Barker, William Field, and Joseph Clarke, to be
the ten present Assistants of the said company, to continue in the
said several offices respectively, until the first Wednesday which
shall be in the month of May now next coming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And further, we will, and, by these presents, for us, our heirs
and successors, do ordain and grant, that the Governor of the said
company, for the time being, or, in his absence, by occasion of sickness
or otherwise, by his leave or permission, the Deputy Governor,
for the time being, shall and may, from time to time, upon all occasions,
give orders for the assembling of the said company, and calling
them together to consult and advise of the business and affairs of
the said company; and that forever hereafter, twice in every year,
that is to say, on every first Wednesday in the month of May, and
on every last Wednesday in October, or oftener, in case it shall be
requisite, the Assistants, and such of the freemen of the said company,
not exceeding six persons for Newport, four persons for each
of the respective towns of Providence, Portsmouth, and Warwick,
and two persons for each other place, town, or city, who shall be,
from time to time, thereunto elected or deputed, by the major part
of the freemen of the respective towns or places, for which they
shall be so elected or deputed, shall have a general meeting or assembly,
then and there to consult, advise, and determine, in and
about the affairs and business of the said company and plantations.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And further, we do, of our especial grace, certain knowledge,
and mere motion, give and grant unto the said Governor and company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>of the English colony of Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations,
in New-England, in America, and their successors, that the
Governor, or, in his absence, or by his permission, the Deputy Governor
of the said company, for the time being, the Assistants and
such of the freemen of the said company, as shall be so aforesaid
elected or deputed, or so many of them as shall be present at such
meeting or assembly, as aforesaid, shall be called the General Assembly;
and that they, or the greatest part of them then present,
(whereof the Governor, or Deputy Governor, and six of the Assistants
at least, to be seven,) shall have, and have hereby given and
granted unto them, full power and authority, from time to time, and
at all times hereafter, to appoint, alter, and change such days, times,
and places of meeting and general assembly, as they shall think fit;
and to choose, nominate, and appoint such and so many persons as
they shall think fit, and shall be willing to accept the same, to be
free of the said company and body politic, and them into the same
to admit; and to elect and constitute such offices and officers, and
to grant such needful commissions as they shall think fit and requisite,
for ordering, managing and despatching of the affairs of the
said Governor and company and their successors; and from time to
time to make, ordain, constitute, and repeal, such laws, statutes, orders
and ordinances, forms and ceremonies of government and magistracy,
as to them shall seem meet, for the good and welfare of
the said company, and for the government and ordering of the lands
and hereditaments herein after mentioned to be granted, and of the
people that do, or at any time hereafter shall, inhabit or be within
the same; so as such laws, ordinances, and constitutions, so made,
be not contrary and repugnant unto, but (as near as may be) agreeable
to the laws of this our realm of England, considering the nature
and constitution of the place and people there; and also to appoint,
order, and direct, erect and settle such places and courts of
jurisdiction, for hearing and determining of all actions, cases, matters,
and things, happening within the said colony and plantation,
which shall be in dispute and depending there, as they shall think
fit; and also to distinguish and set forth the several names and titles,
duties, powers, and limits, of each court, office, and officer, superior
and inferior; and also to contrive and appoint such forms of oaths
and attestations, not repugnant, but (as near as may be) agreeable,
as aforesaid, to the laws and statutes of this our realm, as are convenient

justice, and due execution and discharge of all offices and places of
trust, by the persons that shall be therein concerned; and also to
regulate and order the way and manner of all elections to offices
and places of trust, and to prescribe, limit, and distinguish the number
and bounds of all places, towns, and cities, within the limits and

to the said General Assembly; and also to order, direct, and
authorize the imposing of lawful and reasonable fines, mulcts, imprisonment,
and executing other punishments, pecuniary and corporal,
upon offenders and delinquents, according to the course of
other corporations, within this our kingdom of England; and again,
to alter, revoke, annul, or pardon, under their common seal, or otherwise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>such fines, mulcts, imprisonments, sentences, judgments,
and condemnations, as shall be thought fit; and to direct, rule, order,
and dispose of all other matters and things, and particularly
that which relates to the making of purchases of the native Indians,
as to them shall seem meet; whereby our said people and inhabitants
in the said plantations may be so religiously, peaceably, and
civily governed, as that, by their good life and orderly conversation,
they may win and invite the native Indians of the country to the
knowledge and obedience of the only true God and Saviour of mankind;
willing, commanding, and by these presents, for us, our
heirs and successors, ordaining and appointing, that all such laws,
statutes, orders and ordinances, instructions, impositions, and directions,
as shall be so made by the Governor, Deputy, Assistants,
and freemen, or such number of them as aforesaid, and published in
writing, under their common seal, shall be carefully and duly observed,
kept, performed, and put in execution, according to the true
intent and meaning of the same. And these our letters patent, or
the duplicate of exemplification thereof, shall be, to all and every
such officers, superior or inferior, from time to time, for the putting
of the same orders, laws, statutes, ordinances, instructions, and directions,
in due execution, against us, our heirs and successors, a
sufficient warrant and discharge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And further, our will and pleasure is, and we do hereby, for us,
our heirs and successors, establish and ordain, that, yearly, once in
the year, forever hereafter, namely, the aforesaid Wednesday in
May, and at the town of Newport, or elsewhere, if urgent occasion
do require, the Governor, Deputy Governor, and Assistants of the
said company, and other officers of the said company, or such of
them as the General Assembly shall think fit, shall be in the said
General Court or Assembly, to be held from that day or time, newly
chosen for the year ensuing, by the greater part of the said company
for the time being, as shall be then there present. And if it shall
happen that the present Governor, Deputy Governor, and Assistants,
by these presents appointed, or any such as shall hereafter be
newly chosen into their respective rooms, or any of them, or any
other of the officers of the said company, shall die, or be removed
from his or their several offices or places, before the said general
day of election, (whom we do hereby declare, for a misdemeanor or
default, to be removable by the Governor, Assistants and company,
or such greater part of them, in any of the said public Courts to be
assembled as aforesaid,) that then, and in every such case, it shall

Assistants, and Company aforesaid, or such greater part of them, so
to be assembled, as is aforesaid, in any of their assemblies, to proceed
to a new election of one or more of their company, in the room
or place, rooms or places, of such officer or officers, so dying, or removed,
according to their directions. And immediately upon and
after such election or elections made of such Governor, Deputy
Governor, Assistant, or Assistants, or any other officer of the said
company, in manner and form aforesaid, the authority, office and
power, before given to the former Governor, Deputy Governor, and
other officer or officers so removed, in whose stead and place new
shall be chosen, shall, as to him and them, and every of them respectively,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>cease and determine: Provided, always, and our will
and pleasure is, that as well such as are by these presents appointed
to be the present Governor, Deputy Governor, and Assistants of

two of the Assistants of the said Company, unto whom we do, by
these presents, give full power and authority to require and receive
the same: and the said William Boulston, John Porter, Roger Williams,

belonging, before the said Benedict Arnold and William
Brenton, or one of them, to whom respectively we do hereby give
full power and authority to require, administer, or receive the same:
and further, our will and pleasure is, that all and every other future
Governor, or Deputy Governor, to be elected and chosen by virtue
of these presents, shall give the said engagement before two or more
of the said Assistants of the said Company, for the time being, unto
whom we do, by these presents, give full power and authority to

of the said Company, in the administration of justice, and exercise
of government, and the said plantations, to use, exercise, and
put in execution, such methods, orders, rules, and directions, (not
being contrary and repugnant to the laws and statutes of this our
realm,) as have been heretofore given, used, and accustomed, in
such cases respectively, to be put in practice, until at the next, or
some other General Assembly, especial provision shall be made in
the cases aforesaid.</p>

by these presents, that it shall and may be lawful to and for the said
Governor, or, in his absence, the Deputy Governor, and major part
of the said Assistants for the time being, at any time, when the said
General Assembly is not sitting, to nominate, appoint and constitute
such and so many commanders, governors, and military officers,
as to them shall seem requisite, for the leading, conducting, and
training up the inhabitants of the said plantations in martial affairs,
and for the defence and safeguard of the said plantations; that it
shall and may be lawful to and for all and every such commander,
governor, and military officer, that shall be so as aforesaid, or by
the Governor, or, in his absence, the Deputy Governor, and six of
the Assistants, and major part of the freemen of said Company,
present at any general assemblies, nominated, appointed, and constituted,
according to the tenor of his and their respective commissions
and directions, to assemble, exercise in arms, marshal, array,
and put in warlike posture, the inhabitants of said colony, for their
especial defence and safety; and to lead and conduct the said inhabitants,
and to encounter, repulse, and resist, by force of arms,
as well by sea as by land, to kill, slay, and destroy, by all fitting
ways, enterprises, and means whatsoever, all and every such person
or persons as shall, at any time hereafter, attempt or enterprise the
destruction, invasion, detriment, or annoyance of the said inhabitants
or plantations; and to use and exercise the law martial, in such
cases only as occasion shall necessarily require; and to take and

person or persons, with their ship, or ships, armor, ammunition, or
other goods of such persons, as shall, in hostile manner, invade, or

the native Indians, or other enemies of the said colony.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nevertheless, our will and pleasure is, and we do hereby declare
to the rest of our colonies in New-England, that it shall not be lawful

in America, in New-England, to invade the natives inhabiting
within the bounds and limits of the said colonies, without the knowledge
and consent of the said other colonies. And it is hereby declared,
that it shall not be lawful to or for the rest of the colonies to
invade or molest the native Indians, or any other inhabitants, inhabiting
within the bounds or limits hereafter mentioned, (they having
subjected themselves unto us, and being by us taken into our special
protection,) without the knowledge and consent of the Governor and
Company of our colony of Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Also, our will and pleasure is, and we do hereby declare unto all
Christian kings, princes, and states, that, if any person, who shall
hereafter be of the said Company or Plantation, or any other, by
appointment of the said Governor and Company, for the time being,
shall, at any time or times hereafter, rob or spoil, by sea or land, or
do any hurt, or unlawful hostility, to any of the subjects of us, our
heirs and successors, or to any of the subjects of any prince or state,
being then in league with us, our heirs and successors, upon complaint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>of such injury done to any such prince, or state, or their subjects,
we, our heirs and successors, will make open proclamation,
within any part of our realm of England, fit for that purpose, that
the person or persons committing any such robbery or spoil, shall,
within the time limited by such proclamation, make full restitution
or satisfaction of all such injuries done or committed, so as the said
prince, or others, so complaining, may be fully satisfied and contented;
and if the said person or persons, who shall commit any
such robbery or spoil, shall not make satisfaction accordingly,
within such time so to be limited, that then we, our heirs and successors,
will put such person or persons out of our allegiance and
protection; and, that then it shall and may be lawful and free for all
princes or others to prosecute with hostility such offenders, and
every of them, their and every of their procurers, aiders, abettors,
and counsellors, in that behalf.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Provided, also, and our express will and pleasure is, and we do,
by these presents, for us, our heirs and successors, ordain and appoint,
that these presents shall not in any manner hinder any of our
loving subjects whatsoever from using and exercising the trade of
fishing upon the coast of New-England, in America; but that they,
and every or any of them, shall have full and free power and liberty
to continue and use the trade of fishing upon the said coast; in any
of the seas thereunto adjoining, or any arms of the sea, or salt water
rivers and creeks, where they have been accustomed to fish; and to
build and set upon the waste land, belonging to the said colony and
plantations, such wharves, stages, and work-houses, as shall be
necessary for the salting, drying, and keeping of their fish, to be
taken or gotten upon that coast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And further, for the encouragement of the inhabitants of our said
colony of Providence Plantations to set upon the business of taking
whales, it shall be lawful for them, or any of them, having struck a
whale, dubertus, or other great fish, it or them to pursue unto that
coast, or into any bay, river, cove, creek, or shore, belonging thereto,
and it or them upon the said coast, or in the said bay, river, cove,
creek, or shore, belonging thereto, to kill and order for the best advantage,
without molestation, they making no wilful waste or spoil;
any thing in these presents contained, or any other matter or thing,
to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And further, also, we are graciously pleased, and do hereby declare,
that if any of the inhabitants of our said colony do set upon
the planting of vineyards, (the soil and climate both seeming naturally
to concur to the production of vines,) or be industrious in the
discovery of fishing banks, in or about the said colony, we will, from
time to time, give and allow all due and fitting encouragement
therein, as to others in cases of a like nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And further, of our more ample grace, certain knowledge, and
mere motion, we have given and granted, and by these presents, for
us, our heirs and successors, do give and grant unto the said Governor
and Company of the English colony of Rhode-Island and Providence
Plantations, in the Narraganset Bay, in New-England, in

<p class='c023'>The following letter from that indefatigable antiquary, the late
Theodore Foster, Esq. contains some interesting information, concerning
the residence of Roger Williams, the time of his death, and
the place where he was buried. It is copied from the Rhode-Island
American, of July 16, 1819:</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dear Sir,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“I have, this afternoon, had the pleasure of receiving your polite
letter of yesterday, requesting information relative to your worthy
and distinguished ancestor, Mr. Roger Williams, the Founder of our
State, and for some years its Chief Magistrate and patron. He was
chosen President, Sept. 13, 1654, after his return from his second
successful agency with the Long Parliament in England. In that
office he was continued, by repeated elections, until May 19, 1657,
when he was succeeded in it by Benedict Arnold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In answer to your queries, “At what time did Roger Williams
depart this life? Where did he dwell in Providence? and where was
he buried?” I can only say, that I never met with any record,
printed or manuscript, which I thought more correct, as to the time
of his death, than the account given by Mr. Backus, in his History
of the Baptists, vol. i. p. 515. Governor Hutchinson, in his History
of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 43, says, that he died in the year 1682,
forty-eight years after his banishment. Now, adding forty-eight
years to the year of his removal from Salem to Providence, which,
undoubtedly, was in 1636, it makes the year 1684 as the year of his
death, though Governor Hutchinson, by mistake, says it was in 1682.
From Mr. Williams’ writings, it appears that he was born in 1599;
and, as he died in the eighty-fourth year of his age, it will make the
year 1683, as stated by Mr. Backus, that in which his death happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It appears of record, that on the 16th day of January, 1683, Mr.
Williams, with others, signed a settlement of a controversy which
had long existed between some of the people of Providence and
some of those of Pawtuxet, relative to the Pawtuxet purchase; and
that, on the 10th day of May following, John Thornton, in a letter
to Mr. Hubbard, mentioned his death. So he must have died between
January 16 and May 10, 1683.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The freemen of Providence, in town meeting, July 15, 1771, appointed
a committee, viz. Stephen Hopkins, Amos Atwell, and Darius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>Sessions, Esqrs. to draft an inscription for a monument, which
it was then intended to erect to his memory. In their vote on that
occasion, Mr. Williams was called “<em>the Founder of the Town and
Colony</em>.” The committee did nothing, and the business has slept
from that time. In the summer of that year, (forty-eight years ago)
when much was said respecting a monument for him, though nothing
could be agreed on, his grave was shown to me, near the east
end of the house lot now owned by Mr. Dorr. The foot grave-stone
was then gone, and the top of the other broken off, so that only the
lower part appeared, without any inscription. There were several
other grave-stones near his, in memory of some of the Ashton family,
who were connected with Mr. Williams, on which the inscriptions
were entire. Thinking it a duty to preserve some knowledge
of the place, where was deposited the dust of the founder of our
State, I have repeatedly, of late years, sought for those monuments,
without being able to find any traces of them; though I think I can,
within a rod or two, show where they were placed, so that, on digging
the ground, the graves may, perhaps, be discovered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no doubt but that Mr. Williams lived, the latter part of
his life, upon the estate whereon he was buried, which was called
the Crawford estate, after the connection of the Crawford and Fenner
families, by the marriage of Gideon Crawford with Freelove
Fenner, daughter of Arthur Fenner, April 13, 1687; which Arthur
Fenner, July 31, 1688, gave to his three daughters, Freelove, Bethiah
and Phebe, thirty-one acres of land, “in Providence Neck,” all
which became the property of Mr. Crawford, who married Freelove
Fenner, and I believe was exchanged or negotiated for Mr. Williams’
estate, near the spring.”<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c010'><sup>[395]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>As Mr. Williams’ grave and others before mentioned were on that
estate, I applied, on the 12th of May, 1813, to Mrs. Mary Tripe, a
descendant of the said Gideon Crawford, then in the seventy-second
year of her age, for information respecting them. She was a woman
of intelligence, good sense and information, and careful of what she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>said. She informed me that your ancestor, Roger Williams, lived in
a house which was on the east side of the main street, a little south
of the Episcopal church, the foundation whereof then remained,
which she showed me, within sight of her house, and which I believe
is also now removed, as I saw nothing of it, on looking for it,
the last time I was in Providence. So transitory are all things pertaining
to humanity! She told me there was no doubt that Mr.
Williams was buried at the place which I have mentioned; that she
had always been told so; and that she remembered seeing fruit trees
growing there, when she was a girl; that her father once owned
that and the estate where Moses Brown, Esq. now lives; and that
there was a gang-way, fourteen feet wide, south of Mrs. Tripe’s
house, given by Mr. Williams, to go to his spring, originally laid out
from river to river, near which gang-way his house stood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have an original letter, in the hand writing of Mr. Williams,
to the freemen of the town of Providence, dated “11, 3, 60,” [May
11, 1660] claiming personal estate of John Clowson, who had been
murdered by Waumaion, an Indian, on the 4th day of the preceding
January, containing additional proof that Mr. Williams then lived
near the spring before mentioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can give no satisfactory information relative to the other queries
in your letter, but what may be derived from the records of
Providence; nor have I any recollection of any circumstance which
indicated that Mr. Williams left a will.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It gives me pleasure to be able to furnish useful information to
any of my friends, from documents in my possession. Though in
haste, I have written diffusely, in answer to your letter. So far as
it goes, I believe the information it contains is correct. That it may
in some degree, answer your expectations, and the purpose for
which you wanted it, is the wish of</p>

<p class='c009'>The following extracts from a letter, inserted in the American, of
July 20, 1819, deserve to be inserted, as illustrative of the subject
before us:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

      <div class='line'>“<em>Providence, July 17, 1819.</em></div>

      <div class='line'>“Messrs. Goddard &amp; Knowles,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Observing, in your paper of yesterday, a letter from the Hon.
Theodore Foster, respecting Roger Williams, the founder of this
State, I am induced to lay before the public the following facts, communicated
to me by the late Capt. Nathaniel Packard, of this town,
about the year 1808. About fifty years since, there was some stir
about erecting a monument to commemorate that distinguished divine,
civilian and statesman, and there was a difference of opinion as
to the place of his burial. Capt. Packard was then absent, but had
he been present, he could have pointed out the very spot where
Roger Williams’ house stood, and where he was buried. When he
was about ten years old, one of the descendants of Roger Williams
was buried at the family burying-ground, on the lot right back of the
house of Sullivan Dorr, Esq. Those who dug the grave, dug directly
upon the foot of the coffin, which the people there present told him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>was Roger Williams’. They let him down into the new grave, and
he saw the bones in the coffin, which was not wholly decayed, and
the bones had a long, mossy substance upon them. Roger Williams
was born in 1599, and died in 1683. Captain Packard was son of
Fearnot Packard, who lived in a small house, standing a little south
of the house of Philip Allen, Esq. and about fifty feet south of the
noted spring. In this house Captain Packard was born, in 1730,
and died in 1809, being seventy-nine years old. He was born forty-seven
years after Williams died. So if he was ten years old when
Williams’ descendant was buried, it was fifty-seven years after Williams
died.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As the people at the funeral of Williams’ descendant told Captain
Packard that Williams was buried in the grave dug upon, there
can be no doubt that Roger Williams was buried in the lot back of
Mr. Dorr’s house, in his own family burying-ground, where I myself
have seen stones to a number of the graves, within twenty
years, which have since been removed. But, though the stones are
not to be found, yet I cannot but venerate the spot where, I have no
doubt, the dust of one of the greatest and best men that ever lived
mingled with its mother earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Nabby Packard, widow of Captain Packard, who is eighty-five
years old, told me, this day, that her late husband had often
mentioned the above facts to her; and his daughter, Miss Mary
Packard, states, that her father often told her the same.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>“As to where Roger Williams’ dwelling-house stood, Captain Nathaniel
Packard told me, that when he was a boy, he used to play in
a cellar, which had a large peach-tree in it, which cellar, he said,
was situate on a lot back of the house built by Thomas Owen, father
of the late Hon. Daniel Owen, afterwards owned by Levi Whipple,
and now owned by the heirs of the late Simeon H. Olney, directly
north of the house owned by Ezra Hubbard, and near where an outbuilding
now stands. The people, at that time, called it Roger
Williams’ cellar. Mrs. Nabby Packard, Nathaniel Packard’s widow,
told me this day, that she came to live where she now lives, when
she was eighteen years old, which was sixty-seven years ago, and
that she well remembers the cellar, and that it was called Roger Williams’
cellar. The site of the house was a little east of Roger Williams’
spring, and situate directly on the road laid out from said
spring, to the upper ferry, (now Central Bridge.) The spring is
called Roger Williams’ spring, and he owned the land all around it,
being the very place where he sat upon the rock, and conversed
with the Indians. The above facts, derived from Captain N. Packard,
his widow and daughter, are indubitable evidences, that his
house was where it is above stated to have been, and that he was
buried in the lot back of Mr. Dorr’s house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is hoped, that the prosperous city of Providence will not, much
longer, endure the reproach of permitting her founder’s grave to remain
without any memorial to indicate the spot. It is already too
late, perhaps, to ascertain the precise place where his ashes lie, but it
may be found, within a few feet. The ground around it ought to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>obtained by the city, a handsome monument erected, and the whole
enclosed within a permanent iron fence, and adorned with trees,
shrubbery, &amp;c. It would thus form an interesting spot, which the
citizen would visit with interest, and which the stranger would seek
as one of the principal points of attraction. It has been proposed to
erect a monument in some other part of the city; but it would be absurd
to place it any where else than on the spot where his bones are
interred. The spot itself is interesting, because he owned it, and
was buried there. It is surprising that his children ever allowed it
to be sold.</p>

<p class='c009'>In regard to the family of Mr. Williams, little is now known. Even
his lineal descendants seem to have a very scanty knowledge of their
ancestor. A few facts have been collected, though I cannot vouch
for their accuracy.</p>

<p class='c009'>His wife, it is supposed, survived him, but when and where she
died, we know not.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is nearly certain, that he left no will. He probably had very little,
if any property, to bequeath.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had six children:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Mary, born at Plymouth, the first week in August, 1633.
Whether she was married or not, is uncertain. In Mr. Williams’
book against George Fox, he speaks of his daughter <em>Hart</em>, as residing
in Newport. Mary may have married a person of this name.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Freeborn, born at Salem, the end of October, 1635. Of her,
nothing further is known to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Providence, born at Providence, the end of September, 1638.
He died unmarried, in Newport [another account says, in Providence]
March, 1685–6.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Marcy, born July 15, 1640. She was married to Resolved
Waterman, of Warwick, by whom she had four sons and one daughter.
After his death, she was married to Samuel Winsor, of Providence,
by whom she had two sons and one daughter. After his
death, she was married to —— Rhodes, of Pawtuxet, by whom she
had several children.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Daniel, born February 15, 1641–2. He married Rebecca Power,
widow of Nicholas Power. He died May 14, 1712. He had five sons,
Peleg, Roger, Daniel, Joseph, Providence. Peleg had four sons,
Peleg, Robert, Silas, Timothy; and two daughters, who were married
to Daniel Fisk and John Fisk. Roger had two daughters, one
of whom was married to Jonathan Tourtellot, and the other to David
Thayer. Daniel died unmarried. Joseph had two sons, Benoni and
Goliah. Providence had one daughter, Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Joseph, born the beginning of December, 1643. He married
Lydia Olney, December 17, 1669. He had three sons, Joseph,
Thomas and James. Joseph had one son, Jeremiah, and eight daughters,
who were married to Francis Atwood, William Randall, Joseph
Randall, John Randall, William Dyer, Benjamin Potter, Benjamin
Congdon, John Dyer. Thomas had three sons, Joseph, Thomas
and John, and several daughters. James had four sons, James, Nathaniel,
Joseph and Nathan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Joseph Williams lived, for several years, on a farm in Cranston,
three or four miles from Providence, where he died, August
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>17, 1724, in the eighty-first year of his age, and was buried in the
family burying ground, on the farm, where his grave stone now
stands, with this inscription:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here lies the body of Joseph Williams, Esq. son of Roger Williams,
Esq. who was the first white man that came to Providence.
He was born 1644. He died August 17, 1724, in the eighty-first
year of his age.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In King Philip’s war, he courageously went through,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the native Indians he bravely did subdue,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now he’s gone down to the grave, and he will be no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>Until it please Almighty God his body to restore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Into some proper shape, as he thinks fit to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps like a grain of wheat, as Paul sets forth, you see.</div>
      <div class='line in12'>(<em>Corinthians, 1st book, 15th chapter, 37th verse.</em>)”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>His wife died a few days after him, and was buried by his side.
Her grave-stone bears this inscription:</p>

<p class='c009'>“In memory of Lydia Williams, wife of Joseph Williams, Esq.
who died September 9, 1724, in the eightieth year of her age.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the same yard, is the grave of their youngest son. The stone
has this inscription:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here lies the body of James Williams, son of Joseph Williams
and Lydia his wife, who was born September 24, 1680, died June
25, 1757, in the seventy-seventh year of his age.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He was of a moderate temper and easy mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>He to peace was chiefly inclined;</div>
      <div class='line'>In peace he did live, in peace he would be,</div>
      <div class='line'>We hope it may last to eternity.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c022'><span class='sc'>Note I.</span> p. 389.</h3>

<p class='c023'>That Mr. Williams ought to be regarded as the founder of the
State of Rhode-Island, cannot be denied. His settlement of Providence,
the first town in the State; his services in procuring the
cession of the island by the Indians; his efforts to procure the first
charter, and his various sacrifices and toils for the welfare of the
whole colony, entitle him to the merit of being considered as the
founder, though other men, like Mr. Clarke, rendered great and important
services. Mr. Williams claims this honor, in his letter inserted
on page 349 of this volume.</p>

<p class='c009'>His principles have steadily prevailed in Rhode-Island, till the
present hour. No man has ever been molested, on account of his
religious principles. Gentlemen, of all the existing denominations,
have been elected magistrates. Mr. Callender said, in 1738: “The
civil state has flourished, as well as if secured by ever so many penal
laws, and an Inquisition to put them in execution. Our civil officers
have been chosen out of every religious society, and the public
peace has been as well preserved, and the public councils as well
conducted, as we could have expected, had we been assisted by ever
so many religious tests.”—p. 107.</p>

<p class='c009'>In respect to the religious concerns of the colony, it may be said,
that if they had been such as they have sometimes been represented,
an argument could not fairly be drawn from them unfriendly to Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>Williams’ principles. It must be recollected, that intolerance prevailed
in the neighboring colonies, and Rhode-Island was a refuge
for men of all opinions. There was consequently a great variety of
sects, all weak, at first, and unable to do much towards the support
of religion. Rhode-Island thus suffered from the intolerance of her
neighbors; for if they had granted the enjoyment of religious liberty
to their citizens, many who went to Rhode-Island, and created disturbances
there, would have remained in the other colonies. The
difficulties which arose, in the early part of the history of Rhode-Island,
are rather proofs of the evils of intolerance in the other
colonies, than evidences of the injurious tendencies of Mr. Williams’
doctrines. If all the uneasy and discordant spirits in the other States
of New-England were driven, by the force of intolerant laws, into
Massachusetts, she would speedily lose some portion of her high
character for morality and good order.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the state of religion in Rhode-Island has been misrepresented.
Mr. Callender, nearly a hundred years ago, vindicated the character
of the State. He said, that there were, in the fourteen towns which
then composed the state,<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c010'><sup>[396]</sup></a> thirty religious societies, all of which
were then supplied with ministers, except probably the meetings of
Friends. Of these societies, nine were Baptists, nine Friends, five
Congregationalists, five Episcopalians, and two Sabbatarians.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c010'><sup>[397]</sup></a> Mr.
Callender says, “Thus, notwithstanding all the liberty and indulgence
here allowed, and notwithstanding the inhabitants have been
represented as living without a public worship, and as ungospellized
plantations, we see there is some form of godliness every where
maintained.”—p. 68. He says, in another place:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I take it to have been no dishonor to the colony, that Christians,
of every denomination, were suffered to lead quiet and peaceable
lives, without any fines, or punishments for their speculative opinions,
or for using those external forms of worship, they believed God
had appointed, and would accept. Bigots may call this confusion
and disorder, and it may be so, according to their poor worldly notions
of religion, and the kingdom of Christ. But the pretended
order of human authority, assuming the place and prerogatives of
Jesus Christ, and trampling on the consciences of his subjects, is, as
Mr. R. Williams most justly calls it, “monstrous disorder.”—p. 50.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Notwithstanding our constitution left every one to his own liberty,
and his conscience; and notwithstanding the variety of opinions
that were entertained, and notwithstanding some may have contracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>too great an indifference to any social worship, yet I am well
assured, there scarce ever was a time, the hundred years past, in
which there was not a weekly public worship of God, attended by
Christians, on this island, and in the other first towns of the colony.”—p.
51.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is believed, that at the present time, there are as many religious
societies in Rhode-Island, as in other States, in proportion to the
population, and that the ministry is as well supported, though it is
done by the voluntary liberality of the respective societies. The
state of morality and religion would, it is believed, bear a favorable
comparison with that in other States.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the true test of the effects of Mr. Williams’ principles is their
operation on a large scale. The religious liberty which prevails in
the United States demonstrates, that religion may be sustained, and
diffused, without any dependence on the civil power. It is believed,
that in no other nation on earth, are the principles of Christianity
so efficacious in their influence on the great mass of the inhabitants;
in no other country, are revivals of religion so frequent; in no other
country, are there so few crimes. Here we leave the argument.
May the principles of Roger Williams soon prevail in every land,
and the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord
and of his Christ.</p>

Wood renders it doubtful whether Mr. Williams was educated at
Oxford, or elsewhere. In the absence of all evidence, it might be
thought more probable that he received his education at Cambridge,
where a large proportion of the leading Puritans were educated.
Coke himself was a graduate of Cambridge, and would probably
prefer to place Williams there. Inquiries have been sent to England,

would have been honorable to him, if it had not undeniably sprung
from political motives. He at first prepared a bull, granting Henry’s
request, but in a short time he thought it more conducive to his political
interests to suppress it, and in a fit of anger against the King
for a supposed insult, the Pope issued his sentence, prohibiting the
divorce, and threatening the King with excommunication if he did
not recognise Catharine as his wife. In six days after, he received
intelligence which made him earnestly desire to annul his sentence,
but it was too late. His attribute of infallibility was now found
inconvenient. He could not retract. Henry was exasperated and
renounced his political allegiance, though, in his controversy with
Luther, which won for him from the Pope the title of <em>Defender

<p class='c009'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. Neal (vol. i. p. 236) gives the following specimen of the arbitrary
manner in which the ministers were treated. It is an account of
the examination of the London clergy: “When the ministers appeared
in court, Mr. Thomas Cole, a clergyman, being placed by the
side of the Commissioners, in priestly apparel, the Bishop’s chancellor
from the bench addressed them in these words: ‘My masters,
and ye ministers of London, the Council’s pleasure is, that ye strictly
keep the unity of apparel, like the man who stands here canonically
habited with a square cap, a scholar’s gown priest-like, a tippet, and
in the church a linen surplice. Ye that will subscribe, write <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">volo</span></i>;
those that will not subscribe, write <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolo</span></i>. Be brief, make no words.’
Some of these distressed ministers subscribed for the sake of their
families, but thirty-seven absolutely refused. They were immediately
suspended from office, and told, that unless they should conform
in three months, they should be wholly deprived of their
livings. In 1585 and 1586, it was found, by a survey, that there
were only 2000 ministers, who were able to preach, to serve 10,000
churches. Bishop Sandys, in one of his sermons before the Queen,
told her Majesty, that some of her subjects did not hear one sermon
in seven years, and that their blood would be required of some one.
Elizabeth thought three or four preachers in a county sufficient.”

thither, on account of a fine spring of water there. He soon
left Boston, alleging that he left England because he did not like

he did not like the Lords Brethren. His rights as the first occupant
were acknowledged, and thirty pounds were paid to him in 1634.
He removed to a spot in the present town of Cumberland, (R. I.)
about six miles from Providence, and the river which flows near
now bears his name. He lived to an old age, and occasionally
preached at Providence and other places. Tradition says, that he
sometimes secured the attention of his hearers by a skilful distribution
of apples. His orchard flourished long after his death, and

<p class='c009'>“The weather held tolerable until the 24th of December, but the
cold then came on with violence. Such a Christmas eve they had
never seen before. From that time to the 10th of February their
chief care was to keep themselves warm, and as comfortable, in
other respects, as their scant provisions would permit. The poorer
sort were much exposed, lying in tents and miserable hovels, and
many died of the scurvy and other distempers. They were so short
of provisions, that many were obliged to live upon clams, muscles,
and other shell fish, with ground nuts and acorns instead of bread.
One that came to the Governor’s house, to complain of his sufferings,
was prevented, being informed that even there the last batch
was in the oven. Some instances are mentioned of great calmness
and resignation in this distress. A man who had asked his neighbor
to a dish of clams, after dinner returned thanks to God, who had
given them to suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures
hid in the sands. They had appointed the 22d of February for a
fast; but on the 5th, to their great joy, the ship Lyon, Capt. Peirce,
one of the last year’s fleet, returned, laden with provisions, from
England, which were distributed according to the necessities of the
people. They turned their fast into a thanksgiving.”</p>

prayer and ceremonies, and had suffered much for their non-conformity

<p class='c009'>“All, who are inclined to separate that connection of secular
concerns with the duties of religion, to which most governments, in
all countries, have been too much disposed, will think this opinion of
Roger Williams redounds to his praise. The laws of the first table,
or the four commandments of the decalogue first in order, should be
rather impressed by early education than by penal enactments of the
legislature; and the experience of Rhode Island and other States of
our Union is perhaps favorable to the sentiment of this earliest
American reformer. Too much regulation was the error of our fathers,
who were perpetually arguing from analogies in the Levitical institutions,
and encumbering themselves with the yoke of Jewish customs.”</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. Cotton Mather, in his Magnalia, b. ii. ch. iv. relates the following
incident, as having occurred during this visit. Though the
extract shows his strong prejudices, it may be worth an insertion as
an illustration of the temper and manner of those times. “There
were at this time in Plymouth two ministers, leavened so far with the
humors of the rigid separation, that they insisted vehemently upon
the unlawfulness of calling any unregenerate man by the name of
<em>good-man such a one</em>, until by their indiscreet urging of this whimsey,
the place began to be disquieted. The wiser people being troubled
at these trifles, they took the opportunity of Governor Winthrop’s
being there, to have the thing publicly propounded in the congregation;
who, in answer thereunto, distinguished between a theological
and a moral goodness: adding, that when juries were first used in
England, it was usual for the crier, after the names of persons fit for
that service were called over, to bid them all, <em>Attend, good men and
true</em>; whence it grew to be a civil custom in the English nation for
neighbors living by one another to call one another good-man such a
one, and it was pity now to make a stir about a civil custom, so
innocently introduced. And that speech of Mr. Winthrop’s put
a lasting stop to the little, idle, whimsical conceits, then beginning
to grow obstreperous.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If the preceding statement is true, it may be charitably viewed as
an indication of the scrupulous conscientiousness of Mr. Williams,
who thought, perhaps, that <em>names</em> are sometimes <em>things</em>, and was unwilling
that the term <em>good man</em> should be indiscriminately
applied to all men. If he yielded to Gov. Winthrop’s explanation,
it proves, that he was not so obstinate in trifles, as he has been
represented.</p>

separated from the Church of England, and went to Holland, where
he embraced the sentiments of the Baptists. He is said to have

is said on the authority of his opponents only, who, from the acrimony

evidence.” Neal’s History of the Puritans, vol. ii. p. 72, note.

<p class='c009'><a href='#r61'>61</a>. Backus, vol. i. pp. 57, 516. Dr. Bentley, 1 His. Col. vi. p. 247,

<p class='c009'><a href='#r62'>62</a>. There is a strange confusion in the statements of different writers
respecting the duration of Mr. Williams’ stay at Plymouth, and the
date of his removal. Morton says, that he preached at Plymouth
about three years, and was dismissed in 1634. Baylies repeats this
statement. Hutchinson says, that he remained at Plymouth three
or four years; Cotton Mather says two years, and Dr. Bentley
states, that he returned to Salem before the end of the year 1632.
But Mr. Backus supposes the time of his removal from Plymouth to
have been in August, 1633. “His first child was born there the first
week in August, 1633, (Providence Records) and Mr. Cotton, who
arrived at Boston the fourth of September following, says, he had
removed into the Bay before his arrival.” (Tenet Washed, part 2,
p. 4.) It is certain, from Winthrop’s Journal, vol. i. p. 117, that Mr.
Williams had returned to Salem previously to November, 1633, for
under that date Winthrop says, that he “was removed from Plymouth
thither, (but not in any office, though he exercised by way of
prophecy).” The expression implies, that he had <em>recently</em> removed,
and this agrees with the supposition that he returned to Salem in
August.</p>

would have given less offence. From Williams they were not
at first received in the mildest, or even the most natural sense;
though further reflection satisfied the magistrates that his were not
dangerous. The passages from the Apocalypse were probably not
<em>applied</em> to the honor of the King; and I regret, therefore, that Winthrop
did not preserve them.”</p>

right to subdue the natives by force, and to appropriate their territory,
without their consent, to the uses of the colonists. The King
of Spain founded this right solely on the grant of the Pope, as the
vicegerent of Christ upon earth. The Kings of England, in the sixteenth
century, placed it on the superior claims, which Christians
possessed over infidels.”</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r70'>70</a>. Mr. Endicott’s zeal on this point may be learned from the following
incident, related by Winthrop: “March 7, 1633. At the lecture
at Boston a question was propounded about veils. Mr. Cotton concluded,
that where (by the custom of the place) they were not a
sign of the woman’s subjection, they were not commanded by the
apostle. Mr. Endicott opposed, and did maintain it by the general
arguments brought by the apostle. After some debate, the Governor,
perceiving it to grow to some earnestness, interposed, and so it
brake off.” Vol. i. p. 125.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hutchinson (vol. i. p. 379) says, on the authority of Hubbard, that
“Mr. Cotton, of Boston, happening to preach at Salem, soon after
this custom began, he convinced his hearers that it had no sufficient
foundation in the Scriptures. His sermon had so good an effect,
that they were all ashamed of their veils, and never appeared covered
with them afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r73'>73</a>. The question about the lawfulness of the cross caused much
agitation and controversy. “Some of our chief worthies,” says Cotton
Mather, (Magnalia, b. vii. c. ii. § 9) “maintained their different
persuasions, with weapons indeed no more dangerous than easy pens,
and effects no worse than a little harmless and learned inkshed.”
Mr. Hooker wrote a tract of nearly thirteen pages, in defence of the
cross. Winthrop says, that the Court were “doubtful of the lawful
use of the cross in an ensign.” The militia refused to march with
the mutilated banners. The matter was finally settled, by leaving
out the cross in the colors for the trained bands, and retaining it in
the banners of the castle and of vessels.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r75'>75</a>. That is, April 30. Winthrop adopted, a few months before, this
mode of denoting time. It seems to have arisen from a desire to
avoid the Roman nomenclature, as heathenish. Perhaps an aversion
to the Romish church had a share in producing the change. The
custom continued for more than fifty years, when it was gradually
abandoned, except by the Friends, or Quakers, and Hutchinson
thinks, that the popular prejudice against them hastened the decline
of the custom. The months were called 1st, 2d, &amp;c. beginning with
March, and the days of the week were designated in the same way.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f76'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r76'>76</a>. Since these remarks were written, the author has found in Mr.
Williams’ “Hireling Ministry none of Christ’s,” an “Appendix as
touching oaths, a query.” This Appendix is as follows: “Although
it be lawful (in case) for Christians to invocate the name of the Most
High in swearing; yet since it is a part of his holy worship, and
therefore proper unto such as are his true worshippers in spirit and
in truth; and persons may as well be forced unto any part of the
worship of God as unto this, since it ought not to be used but most
solemnly, and in solemn and weighty cases, and (ordinarily) in such
as are not otherwise determinable; since it is the voice of the two
great lawgivers from God, Moses and Christ Jesus, that in the
mouth of two or three witnesses (not swearing) every word shall
stand: Whether the enforcing of oaths and spiritual covenants upon
a nation, promiscuously, and the constant enforcing of all persons
to practise the worship in the most trivial and common cases in all
courts (together with the ceremonies of book and holding up the
hand, &amp;c.) be not a prostituting of the holy name of the Most High
to every unclean lip, and that on slight occasions, and a taking of it
by millions, and so many millions of times in vain, and whether it
be not a provoking of the eyes of his jealousy who hath said, that he
will not hold him (what him or them soever) guiltless, that taketh
his name in vain.” It seems, from this paragraph, that he considered
taking an oath to be an act of worship; that a <em>Christian</em> might
take one on proper occasions, though not for trivial causes; that an
irreligious man could not sincerely perform this act of worship; and
that no man ought to be <em>forced</em> to perform this act, any more than
any other act of worship. His own practice was agreeable to his
theory. He says, in his George Fox digged out of his Burrowes, (Appendix,
pp. 59, 60) “cases have befallen myself in the Chancery in
England, &amp;c. of the loss of great sums, which I chose to bear,
through the Lord’s help, rather than yield to the <em>formality</em> (then and
still in use) in God’s worship, [alluding, perhaps, to the use of a
book, holding up the hand, &amp;c.] though I offered to swear, in weighty
cases, by the name of God, as in the presence of God, and to attest
or call God to witness; and the judges told me they would rest in
my testimony and way of swearing, but they could not dispense with
me without an act of Parliament.”</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r79'>79</a>. In his “Hireling Ministry none of Christ’s,” he says, on this
subject, “we may hinder and harden poor souls against repentance,
when, by fellowship in prayer with them as with saints, we persuade
them of their [already] blessed state of Christianity, and that
they are new born, the sons and daughters of the living God.” p. 22.
This argument is unsound, because we do not “hold fellowship”
with the impenitent, by praying in their presence; but the argument
shows Mr. Williams’ conscientious regard for the welfare of men.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is worthy of remark, here, that while Winthrop states this
charge as a general proposition, Hubbard (207) and Morton (153)
assert, that Mr. Williams refused to “pray or give thanks at meals
with his own wife or any of his family.” This was probably an inference
from Mr. Williams’ abstract doctrine. Several of the charges
against him might be thus traced to the disposition to draw inferences.
A curious instance is given by Cotton Mather, (Magnalia,
b. vii. ch. ii. § 6.) Mr. Williams, he says, “complained in open
Court, that he was wronged by a slanderous report, as if he held it
unlawful for a father to call upon his child to eat his meat.” Mr.
Hooker, then present, being moved hereupon to speak something,
replied, “Why, you will say as much again, if you stand to your
own principles, or be driven to say nothing at all.” Mr. Williams
expressing his confidence that he should never say it, Mr. Hooker
proceeded: “If it be unlawful to call an unregenerate person to
pray, since it is an action of God’s worship, then it is unlawful for
your unregenerate child to pray for a blessing upon his own meat.
If it be unlawful for him to pray for a blessing upon his meat, it is
unlawful for him to eat it, for it is sanctified by prayer, and without
prayer unsanctified. (1 Tim. iv. 4, 5.) If it be unlawful for him to
eat it, it is unlawful for you to call upon him to eat it, for it is unlawful
for you to call upon him to sin.” Our fathers were adepts in
logic. Mr. Hooker’s syllogisms do not now seem very convincing,
but they must have puzzled Mr. Williams, if he held the notions ascribed
to him. Accordingly, Cotton Mather adds, that “Mr. Williams
chose to hold his peace, rather than to make any answer.”
We may wonder, nevertheless, that Mr. Williams has not been accused
of starving his children, to the horror of succeeding generations!</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r88'>88</a>. About the same time that Bossuet, the most illustrious champion
of the Church of Rome, was engaged in maintaining, with all the
force of his overwhelming eloquence, and inexhaustible ingenuity,
that the sovereign was bound to use his authority in extirpating false
religions from the state, the Scotch Commissioners in London were
remonstrating, in the name of their national Church, against the introduction
of a ‘sinful and ungodly toleration in matters of religion;’
whilst the whole body of the English Presbyterian Clergy, in their
official papers, protested against the schemes of Cromwell’s party, and
solemnly declared, ‘that they detested and abhorred toleration.’ ‘My
judgment,’ said Baxter, a man noted in his day for moderation, ‘I
have always freely made known. I abhor unlimited liberty or toleration
of all.’—‘Toleration,’ said Edwards, another distinguished divine,
‘will make the kingdom a chaos, a Babel, another Amsterdam,
a Sodom, an Egypt, a Babylon. Toleration is the grand work of the
Devil, his master-piece, and chief engine to uphold his tottering kingdom.
It is the most compendious, ready, sure way to destroy all
religion, lay all waste and bring in all evil. It is a most transcendent,
catholic and fundamental evil. As original sin is the fundamental
sin, having the seed and spawn of all sins in it, so toleration hath all
errors in it, and all evils.’ <em>Verplank’s Discourses</em>, pp. 23, 24. Similar
language was used in this country. The Rev. Mr. Ward, in his
Simple Cobler of Agawam, written in 1647, utters his detestation of
toleration, and says: “He that is willing to tolerate any religion, or
decrepit way of religion, besides his own, unless it be in matters
merely indifferent, either doubts of his own, or is not sincere in it.”</p>

the teacher of the church in Roxbury, in 1632. He learned the Indian
language, and commenced preaching to the natives. In 1651,
an Indian town was built, on a pleasant spot on Charles river, about
16 miles from Boston, and called Natick. A house of worship was
erected, and a church of converted Indians was formed, in 1660. In
1661, he published the New Testament, in the Indian language, and
in a few years after, the whole Bible, and several other books. His
labors for the welfare of the natives were very great, and his success
was gratifying. In 1670, there were between 60 and 70 praying
communicants. The example of Eliot was followed by others, especially
by the Mayhews, who labored among the Indians on Nantucket
and Martha’s Vineyard. Many churches were formed in
various places besides Natick, schools established, books printed, and
other efforts made for the welfare of the natives. The aggregate
number of praying Indians, in 1674, has been estimated as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r119'>119</a>. The patents which they brought with them were, in theory,
unjust; for they implied, in terms, the absolute control of the English
monarch over the ceded territory, and contained no recognition
of the rights of the natives. But the Christian integrity of the Pilgrims
corrected, in practice, the error or defect of the patents. An
able writer says: “It is beyond all question, that the early settlers
at Plymouth, at Saybrook, and, as a general rule, all along the Atlantic
coast, purchased the lands upon which they settled, and proceeded
in their settlements with the consent of the natives. Nineteen
twentieths of the land in the Atlantic States, and nearly all the
land settled by the whites in the western States, came into our possession
as the result of amicable treaties.” “The settlers usually
gave as much for land as it was then worth, according to any fair
and judicious estimate. An Indian would sell a square mile of land
for a blanket and a jack-knife; and this would appear to many to be
a fraudulent bargain. It would, however, by no means deserve
such an appellation. The knife alone would add more to the comfort
of an Indian, and more to his wealth, than forty square miles of
land, in the actual circumstances of the case.” See a very judicious
article in the North American Review, for October, 1830. We may
add, that, at this day, a square mile of land might be bought in some
parts of the United States, for less than the first settlers paid the
Indians for their lands. Indeed, as the writer just quoted says,
“There are millions of acres of land in the Carolinas, which would
not, at this moment, be accepted as a gift, and yet much of this land
will produce, with very little labor, one hundred and fifty bushels of
sweet potatoes to the acre.” Vattel says, (book i. § 209) “We cannot
help praising the moderation of the English puritans, who first
settled in New-England, who, notwithstanding their being furnished
with a charter from their sovereign, purchased of the Indians the
land they resolved to cultivate. This laudable example was followed
by Mr. William Penn, who planted the colony of Quakers in
Pennsylvania.”</p>

Gookin says, the Narraganset jurisdiction extended thirty

the islands, southwesterly to a place called Wekapage, four or five
miles to the eastward of Pawcatuck river; that it included a part of
Long-Island, Block-Island, Coweset and Niantick, and received
tribute from some of the Nipmucks. After some research, I am induced

of any of the township to any other persons since the twelve men
were first in power, &amp;c. If my father had disposed or sold his
whole township, and they he sold it to, or have it under his hand,
prove the sale, although it was but for one penny, God forbid that
ever I should open my mouth about it, &amp;c. It is evident, that this
township was my father’s, and it is held in his name against all
unjust clamors, &amp;c. Can you find such another now alive, or in
this age? He gave away his lands and other estate, to them that
he thought were most in want, until he gave away all, so that he
had nothing to help himself, so that he being not in a way to get
for his supply, and being ancient, it must needs pinch somewhere.
I do not desire to say what I have done for both father and mother.
I judge they wanted nothing that was convenient for ancient
people, &amp;c. What my father gave, I believe he had a good intent
in it, and thought God would provide for his family. He never
gave me but about three acres of land, and but a little afore he deceased.
It looked hard, that out of so much at his disposing, that I
should have so little, and he so little. For the rest, &amp;c. I did not
think to be so large; so referring your honors to those queries you

by Mr. Williams himself, and by others, but it was soon discontinued.
The origin of the epithet <em>New</em> may have been, a desire to
distinguish the town from the island of Providence, one of the Bahama
islands, on which a plantation was begun in 1629. Holmes’
Annals, vol. i. p. 201. This island has since received the name of
New Providence. The town of Roger Williams was entitled to the

mean that he delivered the deed to the grantees in 1637, for several
of the persons named, did not arrive in Providence till after April,
1638. (Backus, vol. i. p. 92.) His own deed of cession is dated
Oct. 8, 1638. He probably meant, that he delivered the deed, signed
by the sachems in 1637, to the purchasers. This deed was dated

the individuals who were engaged in the murder, and to pay four
hundred fathoms of wampumpeag, forty beaver skins, and thirty
otter skins. While the Pequod ambassadors were at Boston, a party
of the Narragansets came as far as Naponset, and it was rumored
that their object was to murder the Pequod ambassadors. The
magistrates had a conference at Roxbury, with the Narragansets,
(among whom were two sachems) and persuaded them to make
peace with the Pequods, to which the sachems agreed, the magistrates
having secretly promised them, as a condition, a part of the
wampumpeag, which the Pequods had stipulated to pay. The
note of Mr. Savage, on this affair, deserves to be repeated:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If any doubt has ever been entertained, in Europe or America, of
the equitable and pacific principles of the founders of New-England,
in their relations with the Indians, the secret history, in the foregoing
paragraph, of this negotiation, should dissipate it. By the unholy
maxims of vulgar policy, the discord of these unfriendly nations
would have been encouraged, and our European fathers should have
employed the passions of the aborigines for their mutual destruction.
On the contrary, an honest artifice was resorted to for their reconciliation,
and the tribute received by us from one offending party was,
by a Christian deception, divided with their enemies, to procure
mutual peace. Such mediation is more useful than victory, and
more honorable than conquest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be added, here, as an illustration of the temper of the
times, that Mr. Eliot, the Indian apostle, expressed, in a sermon,
some disapprobation of this treaty with the Pequods, for this reason,
among others, that the magistrates and ministers acted without authority
from the people. He was called to account, and Mr. Cotton
and two other ministers were appointed to convince him of his error.
The good man appeared to be convinced, and agreed to make a
public retraction. It is stated by Dr. Bentley, that Mr. Williams,
then at Salem, expressed his disapprobation of the treaty, doubtless
on the same ground, of the combination of civil and clerical agency
in the transaction. But Mr. Williams would not retract, after the
example of Eliot.</p>

whom were thirteen sachems. About two hundred, besides women
and children, survived the swamp fight. Of this number, the English
gave eighty to Miantinomo, and twenty to Ninigret, two sachems
of Narraganset, and the other hundred to Uncas, sachem of
the Mohegans, to be received and treated as their men. A number
of the male children were sent to Bermuda. However just the occasion
of this war, humanity demands a tear on the extinction of a
valiant tribe, which preferred death to what it might naturally anticipate
from the progress of English settlements—dependence, or
extirpation.</p>

their first coming thither, Mr. Williams and the rest did make an
order, that no man should be molested for his conscience, now men’s
wives, and children, and servants, claimed liberty hereby to go to
all religious meetings, though never so often, or though private, upon
the week days; and because one Verin refused to let his wife go to
Mr. Williams so oft as she was called for, they required to have him
censured. But there stood up one Arnold, a witty man of their own
company, and withstood it, telling them, that when he consented to
that order, he never intended it should extend to the breach of any
ordinance of God, such as the subjection of wives to their husbands,
&amp;c. and gave divers solid reasons against it. Then one Greene,
(who hath married the wife of one Beggerly, whose husband is
living, and no divorce, &amp;c. but only, it was said, that he had lived
in adultery and had confessed it,) he replied, that if they should restrain
their wives, &amp;c. all the women in the country would cry out
of them, &amp;c. Arnold answered him thus: Did you pretend to leave
Massachusetts because you would not offend God to please men,
and would you now break an ordinance and commandment of God,
to please women? Some were of opinion, that if Verin would not
suffer his wife to have her liberty, the church should dispose her to
some other man who would use her better. Arnold told them, it was
not the woman’s desire, to go so oft from home, but only Mr. Williams’
and others. In conclusion, when they would have censured
Verin, Arnold told them, that it was against their own order, for
Verin did that he did out of conscience; and their order was, that
no man should be censured for his conscience.”</p>

“At Providence, things grew still worse; for a sister of Mrs. Hutchinson,
the wife of one Scott, being infected with anabaptistry, and going
last year to live at Providence, Mr. Williams was taken (or rather
emboldened) by her to make open profession thereof, and accordingly
was re-baptized by one Holliman, a poor man, late of Salem. Then
Mr. Williams re-baptized him and some ten more. They also denied

Lathrop was chosen in his room. But nine years after, several persons
in the society, finding that the congregation kept not to their
first principles of separation, and being also convinced, that baptism
was not to be administered to infants, but such only as professed faith
in Christ, desired and obtained liberty, and formed themselves into
a distinct church, Sept. 12, 1633, having Mr. John Spisbury for their
minister.”—Crosby, vol. i. pp. 148, 149. In the year 1639, another

<p class='c009'><a href='#r209'>209</a>. The excellent John Robinson, the father of the Plymouth colony,
had a controversy with the Rev. Mr. Bernard, an Episcopal minister.
Mr. Robinson wrote a book, entitled “A Justification of Separation
from the Church of England.”—In this book, he uses the same argument
as that in the text: “Zanchy, upon the fifth to the Ephesians, treating of baptism, propounds a question of a Turk, coming to
the knowledge of Christ and to faith by reading the New Testament,
and withal teaching his family and converting it and others to Christ,
and being in a country whence he cannot easily come to Christian
countries, whether he may baptize them, whom he hath converted
to Christ, he himself being unbaptized? He answers, I doubt not of
it, but that he may, and withal provide that he himself be baptized
of one of the three converted by him. The reason he gives is, because
he is a minister of the word, extraordinarily stirred up by
Christ; and so as such a minister may, with the consent of that
small church, appoint one of the communicants, and provide that he
be baptized by him.” Backus, vol. i. p. 106.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f210'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r210'>210</a>. The question, which has been asked, with some emphasis, as if
it vitally affected the Baptist churches in this country: “<em>By whom
was Roger Williams baptized?</em>” has no practical importance. All
whom he immersed were, as Pedobaptists must admit, baptized. The
great family of Baptists in this country did not spring from the First
Church in Providence. Many Baptist ministers and members came,
at an early period, from Europe, and thus churches were formed in
different parts of the country, which have since multiplied over the
land. The first Baptist church formed in the present State of Massachusetts,
is the church at Swansea. Its origin is dated in 1663,
when the Rev. John Miles came from Wales, with a number of the
members of a Baptist church, who brought with them its records.
It was, in fact, an emigration of a church. Of the 400,000 Baptist
communicants now in the United States, a small fraction only have
had any connection, either immediate or remote, with the venerable
church at Providence, though her members are numerous, and she has
been honored as the mother of many ministers. The question, discussed
in the preceding pages, disturbed, for a while, the first English
Baptists. They had no clerical administrator, who had himself, in
their view, been baptized. Some of them went to Holland, and were
baptized by Baptist ministers there. “But,” says Crosby, (vol. i. p.
103,) “the greatest number of the English Baptists, and the more
judicious, looked upon all this as needless trouble, and what proceeded
from the old Popish doctrine of right to administer sacraments
by an uninterrupted succession, which neither the Church
of Rome, nor the Church of England, much less the modern dissenters,
could prove to be with them. They affirmed, therefore,
and practised accordingly, that after a general corruption of baptism,
an unbaptized person might warrantably baptize, and so begin
a reformation.” These examples, however, cannot justify a departure
from the usual practice of our churches at the present day, when the
ministry is regularly established.</p>

was built in 1770. On the question among the founders of it,
on what lot to place the building, they decided on the present site of
the old college, because it was the home lot of Chad Brown, the first
minister of the Baptist church. Other land could have been obtained,
but the reason given prevailed in fixing the site. Had the impression
been prevalent, that Roger Williams was the first minister or
principal founder of the society, his home lot could have been purchased,
which was a situation fully as eligible for the purpose. If
any doubts rested in the minds of the gentlemen at that time, as to
the validity of the claim of Chad Brown to this preference, perhaps
the circumstance of Mr. Williams’ deserting the order, and protesting
against it, might have produced the determination in favor of Brown.”</p>

Williams’ spring. It was probably a small and rather rude building.
Tradition states, that it was “in the shape of a hay cap, with a fireplace
in the middle, the smoke escaping from a hole in the roof.” It
was taken down, and a larger building erected in 1718. In 1774–5,
the spacious and elegant house now occupied by the First Baptist
Church, was erected.</p>

for the King, lay hold on Gorton, and he, again, on the other side,
called forth, All you that are for the King, lay hold on Coddington;
whereupon Gorton was banished the island; so, with his wife, he
went to Providence. They began about a small trespass of swine,
but it is thought some other matter was ingredient.” Lechford’s

to interfere; but we have seen no evidence of this, and
it is in itself highly improbable. The utmost which we can suppose

Providence, being all anabaptists, were divided in judgment; some
were only against baptizing of infants, others denied all magistracy
and churches, &amp;c. of which Gorton, who had lately been whipped
at Aquetneck, [Newport] was their instructer and captain.” This
observation is worthy of notice, as it shows how loosely this fearful
word anabaptist was applied, and as it discriminates between those
who merely rejected the baptism of infants, and those who denied
all magistracy and churches. It is certain, that all the inhabitants
were not Baptists; and it is doubtful whether the allegation against
Mr. Gorton, that he was opposed either to churches or magistracy,
could be sustained. A letter from the Hon. Samuel Eddy, inserted
in a note to Winthrop’s Journal, vol. ii. p. 58, after mentioning that
Gorton was in office almost constantly, after the establishment of
a government, says: “It would be a remarkable fact, that a man
should be an enemy to magistracy, to religion, in short, a bad man,
and yet constantly enjoy the confidence of his fellow townsmen, and
receive from them the highest honors in their gift.”</p>

of his sufferings. Mr. Winslow, the agent for Massachusetts,
answered him. In 1665, he preferred his petition to the commissioners
sent over by King Charles the Second, for recompense for
the wrongs done him by Massachusetts, alleging, that besides his
other sufferings, he and his friends had eighty head of cattle taken
and sold. Massachusetts, in their answer, charge him with heretical tenets, both in religion and civil government, and with an unjust
possession of the Indian lands in the vicinity of the colonies,
for the sake of disturbing their peace; and add, that the goods which
they seized did not amount to the charge of their prosecution; but
they do not sufficiently vindicate their seizing their persons or goods,
without the limits of their jurisdiction, and conclude with hoping
that his Majesty will excuse any circumstantial error in their proceedings.”

Williams and his colony, because the Baptists began to multiply.
A Baptist church was formed about this time, in Newport, by Dr.
John Clarke and a few others, and in Massachusetts itself the new
doctrine spread. The General Court was aroused, therefore, to an
effort to crush the growing sect; and no method seemed to promise
more success, than to wield against it a legislative denunciation,
edged by an appeal to the popular dread of anabaptism:</p>

since, they have been the incendiaries of the commonwealth, and
the infectors of persons in main matters of religion, and the troublers
of churches in all places where they have been, and that they who have
held the baptizing of infants unlawful, have usually held other errors
or heresies therewith, though they have (as other heretics use to do)
concealed the same till they spied out a fit advantage and opportunity
to vent them, by way of question or scruple; and whereas divers of
this kind have, since our coming into New-England, appeared
amongst ourselves, some whereof (as others before them) denied the
ordinance of magistracy, and the lawfulness of making war, and
others the lawfulness of magistrates, and their inspection into any
breach of the first table; which opinions, if they should be connived
at by us, are like to be increased amongst us, and so must necessarily
bring guilt upon us, infection and trouble to the churches, and
hazard to the whole commonwealth; it is ordered and agreed, that,
if any person or persons, within this jurisdiction, shall either openly
condemn or oppose the baptizing of infants, or go about secretly to
seduce others from the approbation or use thereof, or shall purposely
depart the congregation at the ministration of the ordinance, or shall
deny the ordinance of magistracy, or their lawful right and authority
to make war, or to punish the outward breaches of the first table,

therein, after due time and means of conviction, every such person

quoted here:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncas, the sachem of the Mohegans, was hated and envied by
the Narragansets, for his attachment to the English, and the distinguishing
favors shown him in return. In 1638, having entertained
some of the Pequods, after the war with them, and fearing he had
given offence, he came to the Governor at Boston, and brought a
present, which was at first refused, but afterwards, the Governor
being satisfied that he had no designs against the English, it was
accepted, and he promised to submit to such orders as he should receive
from the English, concerning the Pequods, and also concerning
the Narragansets, and his behavior towards them, and concluded
his speech with these words: ‘This heart (laying his hand
upon his breast) is not mine, but yours. Command me any difficult
service, and I will do it; I have no men, but they are all yours. I
will never believe any Indian against the English any more.’ He
was dismissed, with a present, went home joyful, carrying a letter
of protection for himself and men through the English plantations,
and never was engaged in hostilities against any of the colonies,
although he survived Philip’s war, and died a very old man, after
the year 1680.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Narragansets failed in the payment of the wampum, and in
1646, messengers were sent to them from the commissioners, but
Passacus, their chief sachem, not attending, in 1647 the message
was repeated, and he then pretended sickness, and sent Ninigret,
a sachem of the Nianticks, to act in his behalf, and told the messenger,
that it was true he had not kept his covenant, but added, that he
entered into it for fear of the army which he saw, and that he was
told, that if he did not set his hand to such and such things, the
army should go against the Narragansets. When Ninigret appeared,
he asked how the Narragansets became indebted to the English in
so large a sum, and being told that it was for the expense the Narragansets
had put them to by their breach of covenant, he then
pleaded poverty, but the commissioners insisting on the demand, he
sent some of his people back to procure what he could, but brought
two hundred fathoms only. They gave him leave to go home, and
allowed him further time. The whole was not paid until 1650, when
Capt. Atherton, with twenty men, was sent to demand the arrears,
which was then about three hundred fathoms. Passacus put him off
some time with dilatory answers, not suffering him to come into his
presence. In the mean while his people were gathering together, but
the Captain, carrying his twenty soldiers to the door of the wigwam,
entered himself, with his pistol in his hand, leaving his men without,
and seizing Passacus by the hair of his head, drew him from the
midst of a great number of his attendants, threatening that if one of
them offered to stir, he would despatch him. Passacus presently
paid down what was demanded, and the English returned in safety.
Ninigret, after this, began to stir up new troubles from the Nianticks,
but upon sending Capt. Davis, with a troop of horse, into the
Indian country, he was struck with a panic, and would not be seen
by the English until he had assurance of his life, and then he readily
complied with their demands, and they and the other Indians continued
quiet many years, until by familiar intercourse, and the use
of fire-arms, they became more emboldened, and engaged in the war
in 1675, which issued in their total destruction. <em>Records of United

by a liberal education in the Universities of Cambridge and
of Dublin, and by travel upon the continent. He arrived at Boston,
in October, 1635, with authority to make a settlement in Connecticut,
and the next month despatched a number of persons to build a
fort at Saybrook. He was chosen Governor in 1657, and again in
1659, and from that period he was annually re-elected till his death.
In 1661, he went to England, and procured a charter, incorporating
Connecticut and New-Haven into one colony. He died at Boston,
April 5, 1676, in the 71st year of his age. He possessed a rich variety
of knowledge, and was particularly skilled in chemistry and
physic. His valuable qualities as a gentleman, a christian, a philosopher,

found in the Massachusetts Records, vol. 3, p. 47:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, we received lately out of England a charter from the authority
of the High Court of Parliament, bearing date 10 December,
1643, whereby the Narraganset Bay, and a certain tract of land
wherein Providence and the Island of Aquetneck are included,
which we thought fit to give you and other of our countrymen in
those parts notice of, that you may forbear to exercise any jurisdiction
therein, otherwise to appear at our next General Court, to be holden
the first fourth day of the eighth month, to show by what right you
claim any such jurisdiction, for which purpose yourself and others,
your neighbors, shall have free liberty to come, stay and sojourn, as
the occasion of the said business may require.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dated at Boston, in the Massachusetts, 27th 6mo. 1645.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Mr. Roger Williams, of Providence. By order of the Council.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>No notice of this charter has been found in Winthrop, Hutchinson,
or Holmes’ Annals. Mr. Williams, in his letter to Major Mason,
says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some time after the Pequod war, and our charter from the Parliament,
the government of Massachusetts wrote to myself (then
chief officer in this colony) of their receiving of a patent from the
Parliament for these vacant lands, as an addition to the Massachusetts,
&amp;c. and thereupon requiring me to exercise no more authority, &amp;c.
for they wrote, their charter was granted some weeks before ours.
I returned what I believed righteous and weighty to the hands of
my true friend, Mr. Winthrop, the first mover of my coming into
these parts, and to that answer of mine I never received the least
reply; only it is certain, that at Mr. Gorton’s complaint against the
Massachusetts, the Lord High Admiral, President, said openly, in a
full meeting of the Commissioners, that he knew no other charter for
these parts than what Mr. Williams had obtained, and he was sure
that charter, which the Massachusetts Englishmen pretended, had
never passed the table.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This whole transaction is somewhat mysterious. The rulers in
Massachusetts were too upright to assert the existence of such a
document, if they had it not in their possession. They were too
honest and too politic to forge one, the spuriousness of which could
easily be detected. There was, undoubtedly, some mistake, and the
silence of the historians corroborates the representation given above
by Mr. Williams.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r276'>276</a>. Mr. Neal (vol. iv. ch. 1) says, that after the death of Charles I.
the House of Commons assumed the government, “the House of
Lords was voted useless, and the office of a king unnecessary, burdensome
and dangerous. The form of government for the future
was declared to be a free commonwealth, the executive power lodged
in the hands of a Council of State of forty persons, with full power
to take care of the whole administration for one year. New keepers
of the great seal were appointed, from whom the judges received
their commissions. The oaths of allegiance and supremacy were
abolished, and a new one appointed, called the <em>engagement</em>, which
was, to be true and faithful to the government established, without
King or House of Peers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As great a change took place in ecclesiastical affairs. Episcopacy
was abolished, by law, in 1646; a Directory was substituted for the
Liturgy, a large part of the livings were distributed among the
Presbyterian clergy, and finally, in 1649, Presbyterianism was declared,
by act of Parliament, to be the established religion. The
Presbyterians were fully as tenacious of the <em>divine right</em> of their
polity as the Episcopalians were of theirs; and Dissenters were
treated with nearly as much rigor under the Presbyterian rule, as
they were by the Prelates. The Presbyterians refused to grant toleration
to the Independents, and insisted on their submission. A
number of the Presbyterian ministers and elders in London published
a piece, in 1649, “in which they represent the doctrine of universal
toleration as contrary to godliness, opening a door to libertinism
and profaneness, and a tenet to be rejected as a soul poison.” The
ministers of Lancashire published a paper, in 1648, in which they
remonstrated against toleration, “as putting a cup of poison into the
hands of a child, and a sword into that of a madman; as letting
loose madmen, with firebrands in their hands, and appointing a city
of refuge in men’s consciences for the devil to fly to; and instead of
providing for tender consciences, taking away all conscience.”
Neal, vol. iii. p. 313. The Presbyterians might well dislike Cromwell,
who curbed their intolerant spirit. They had time for reflection,
when, at the restoration, the Episcopal clergy expelled thousands
of them from their livings, and treated them as they had
treated their Independent brethren.</p>

obliged to provide for his own support, while his large family, we
may presume, were injured by his absence. The General Assembly
of the towns of Providence and Warwick, expressed in a letter, their
regret, that they could not send him money, in consequence of their
domestic trials, but informed him that they meant to aid his family.
In his “Bloody Tenet made more Bloody,” he mentions his exertions
to supply the poor in London with fuel, during the civil wars; to
which service he was led, probably, by his benevolent and active
temper, as well as by the desire to obtain a subsistence. He says:
“I can tell, that when these discussions were prepared for the public
in London, his time was eaten up in attendance upon the service of
the Parliament and city, for the supply of the poor of the city with
wood, during the stop of the coal from Newcastle, and the mutinies of
the poor for firing [for which service, he adds in a note, through the
hurry of the times and the necessity of his departure, he lost his recompense
to this day.] It is true, he might have run the road of preferment,
as well in Old as in New-England, and have had the leisure
and time of such who eat and drink with the drunken, and smite
with the fist of wickedness their fellow-servants.” (p. 38.) In his
letter to the town of Providence, in 1654, he says, “I was unfortunately
fetched and drawn from my employment, and sent to so vast
distance from my family to do your work of a high and costly nature,
for so many days, and weeks, and months together, and there left to
starve, or steal, or beg, or borrow. But blessed be God, who gave me
favor to borrow one while, and to work another, and thereby to pay
your debts there, and to come over with your credit and honor, as an
agent from you, who had in your name grappled with the agents and
friends of all your enemies round about you.” Few stronger examples
of disinterested patriotism could be found in any age or country.</p>

the General Assembly “ordered, that the seal with the motto <em>Rhode

He said, that he attacked the Long-Island Indians, because
they had killed a sachem’s son, and sixty of his men, and he
would not make peace with them. He asked of the commissioners,
in a tone, which showed that he considered the Narragansets as a perfectly
independent nation: “If your Governor’s son was slain, and
several other men, would you ask counsel of <em>another nation</em> when and

He had an estate of six or seven hundred pounds a year, which he
turned into money, and embarked his all to promote the settlement of
New-England. He was eleven times chosen Governor of Massachusetts,
and spent his whole estate in the public service. His son
and grandson were successively Governors of Connecticut. He was
a great and good man. His Journal is a monument to his memory—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ære

<p class='c009'><a href='#r297'>297</a>. Winthrop, vol. ii. p. 172, after stating, that an application from
Newport, for powder and other ammunition was rejected, says, “it
was an error, (in state policy at last) not to support them, for though
they were desperately erroneous, and in such distractions among
themselves as portended their ruin, yet, if the Indians should prevail
against them, it would be a great advantage to the Indians and
danger to the whole country.” About the year 1655, Mr. Clarke sent
over from England four barrels of powder, and eight of shot and
bullets, which were consigned to Mr. Williams, and left, by order
of the General Assembly, in his possession. While provision was
thus made for defence against the Indians, measures were adopted
to prevent hostilities. At a town meeting in Providence, June 24,
1655, at which Mr. Williams was moderator, it was voted, that if
any person should sell a gallon of wine or spirits to an Indian, either
directly or indirectly, he should forfeit six pounds, one half to the
informer, and the other half to the town. Among the measures
adopted for defence, was the following order, passed in town meeting,
March 6, 1655–6: “Ordered, that liberty is given to as many as
please to erect a fortification upon the Stamper’s Hill, or about their
own houses.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f298'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r298'>298</a>. This religious society, says Hannah Adams, “began to be distinguished
about the middle of the seventeenth century. Their doctrines
were first promulgated in England, by George Fox, about the
year 1647, for which he was imprisoned at Nottingham, in the year
1649, and the year following at Derby. The appellation of <em>Quakers</em>,
was given them by way of contempt; some say, on account of their
<em>tremblings</em> under the impression of divine things; but <em>they</em> say it was
first given them by one of the magistrates, who committed George
Fox to prison, on account of his bidding him and those about him to
<em>tremble</em> at the word of the Lord.” They have since called themselves
Friends. The wild fanaticism of some of the early adherents
of the sect, no more resembles the quiet demeanor of the pious
Friends of the present day, than the policy of Massachusetts in 1656,
was like the spirit of our own times.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r302'>302</a>. In his “George Fox digged out of his Burrowes,” (p. 20,) Mr.
Williams says of Mr. Harris, his “facts and courses others (of no
small authority and prudence among us, with whom I advised) saw
to be desperate high treason against the laws of our mother England,
and of the colony also.” He then inquires, “was it my fury (as you
call it) or was it not honesty and duty to God and the colony, and
the higher powers then in England, to act faithfully and impartially
in the place wherein I then stood sentinel?”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f303'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r303'>303</a>. The origin of this unhappy quarrel is unknown. There were,
probably, faults on both sides. They both used very angry and unjustifiable
language towards each other. It appears that Mr. Williams
so disliked Mr. Harris, that he would not write his name at
length, but abbreviated it thus, “W. Har:” This mode of writing
is seen in the fac simile prefixed to this volume. It seems evident,
that Mr. Harris had, for some cause, a remarkable aptitude to get
into difficulties. A letter of the town of Providence, to the “Honored
Governor and Council at Newport on Rhode-Island,” dated August
31, 1668, and signed “Shadrach Manton, town clerk,” accuses him
of turbulent conduct. In 1667, there was a great disturbance at
Providence, excited, as it appears, by him. Two town meetings
were held, and two sets of deputies chosen to the General Assembly,
among whom was Mr. Harris. He was, however, expelled from the
General Assembly, and fined fifty pounds, which fine was remitted
the next year.—Backus, vol. i. p. 457. We may hope, that Mr.
Harris, though he doubtless had faults, was less culpable, than his
contemporaries thought him. It was an unquiet time, and few public
men escaped censure.</p>

“June 2, 1657. Ordered, that Mr. Roger Williams be accommodated

to it, in the judgment of the town deputies.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f305'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r305'>305</a>. Pope (Essay on Man, Ep. iv. l. 284,) has aided in confirming the
prejudice against Cromwell, by his famous line:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“See Cromwell damned to everlasting fame.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>Pope sometimes sacrificed truth to a brilliant couplet. The two lines
which immediately precede the one just quoted are a specimen:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If parts allure thee, think how Bacon shined,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>Public opinion now does not sustain the poet, in stigmatizing the great
Bacon as the “meanest of mankind,” but views him as more sinned
against than sinning. We may learn from these examples, how
great is the responsibleness of popular authors. By a single line they
may perpetuate calumny. They may poison the wells of knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f306'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r306'>306</a>. Examples might be cited, of language like this, in American
authors. They show the effect of a discreditable deference to foreign
writers. But all American authors are not disposed to echo the infidel
and tory opinions of England. Dr. Stiles, in his History of the
Judges, defended Cromwell; and a writer in the Christian Spectator,
for September, 1829, has vindicated the character of the Protector,
with ability and eloquence.</p>

Waldenses, who were at that time suffering a merciless persecution,
claim for him the gratitude of every friend of religion and liberty.
He appointed a day of national humiliation and prayer throughout
all England and Wales, and ordered that a collection should be
made in all the houses of worship, for the relief of the sufferers. He
himself headed a subscription, with the liberal donation of two thousand
pounds, and in a short time the large sum of nearly forty thousand
pounds was raised and transmitted. Not contented with this
measure, he sent letters to the Duke of Savoy, the inhuman persecutor,
and to several of the princes of Europe, for the purpose of
procuring deliverance for the miserable remnants of the Waldenses.
The potent voice of the formidable Protector, which none of the
monarchs of that day ventured to despise, uttered, as it was, by the
powerful pen of Milton, the Latin Secretary, had some effect, though
less than he hoped, to soften the rage of bigotry and persecution.
The following sonnet was written by Milton on this occasion:</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r312'>312</a>. Judging from the rapid progress of free principles in England,
it would not be surprising if Cromwell should, ere long, be recognised
as one of the great leaders in the struggle for freedom. Mr.
Ivirney, in his life of Milton, (p. 131,) says of Cromwell, “for whose
statue I venture to bespeak a niche among the illustrious dead in
Westminster Abbey; not doubting, from recent events, but the time
will come, when the governors of the nation will be so sensible of
the obligations of Britain to that illustrious ruler and his noble compatriots,
as maugre the mean power of ignorance and prejudice, will
decree him a monumental inscription in the sepulchres of our kings.”</p>

Cromwell, of which the following is an extract. The address was
never presented:</p>

<p class='c009'>“May it please your Highness to know, that this poor colony of

Providence of the Most High, we being an outcast people, formerly
from our mother nation, in the bishops’ days, and since from the

the present frame and constitution of our dearest mother England;
bearing with the several judgments and consciences each of other
in all the towns of our colony, which our neighbor colonies do not,
which is the only cause of their great offence against us. Sir, we

ten, and Warwick nine. May 21, 1661, two hundred pounds sterling
were voted, of which Newport was to pay eighty-five, Providence
forty, Portsmouth forty, and Warwick thirty-five. Subsequent appropriations,
to the amount of three hundred and six pounds, are
found on the records. The relative size of the towns may be inferred
from the above apportionment. Newport was more than twice as
large as Providence. A record of the names of the freemen in the several
towns, in 1655, states the numbers thus: Newport, eighty-three;
Portsmouth, fifty-two; Providence, forty-two; Warwick, thirty-eight—total,
two hundred and fifteen.</p>

preface, signed by Gregory Dexter, and entitled “An instrument, or
sovereign plaster, to heal the manifold sores in this town or plantation
of Providence, which do arise about lands.” This document says:
“1st. That act, to divide to the men of Pawtuxet twenty miles, is
hereby declared against as unjust and unreasonable, not being healthful,
but hurtful. 2. Whereas great and manifold troubles have befallen
both ourselves and the whole colony, by reason of that phrase,
“up streams without limits, we might have for the use of our cattle,”
for preventing future contention, we declare that our bounds are limited
in our town evidences, and by us stated, about twenty years
since, and known to be the river and fields of Pawtucket, Sugar
Loaf Hill, Bewett’s Brow, Observation Rock, Absolute Swamp, Oxford
and Hipe’s Rock.&nbsp;**** No other privilege, by virtue of the said
phrase, to be challenged by this town, viz. that if the cattle went
beyond the bounds prefixed in the said deed granted to him, [Mr.
Williams] then the owners of the cattle should be no trespassers, the
cattle going so far in one day to feed as they might come home at
night. 3. And whereas some of us have desired of the colony leave
to purchase for this town some enlargement, which was granted, and
by the great diligence of our said neighbor, Williams, with the natives,
more land is bought, adjoining your said bounds,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r324'>324</a>. It is an honorable proof of steadiness of character in the people
of Rhode-Island, that they have continued to prosper under this
charter for one hundred and seventy years. No interruption of the
government has occurred during this long period, and no attempt
has been made to resist it. No community ever enjoyed more perfect
freedom, and yet none was ever more quiet and obedient to the
laws. It is a gratifying evidence, that a truly free government is
more stable than any other. The growth of the State has made some
provisions of the charter operate unjustly. Providence, for example,
with sixteen thousand inhabitants, sends only four representatives
to the General Assembly, while Portsmouth, with seventeen
hundred inhabitants, sends four, and Newport, with eight thousand,
sends six. An attempt was made, a few years since, to obtain a new
Constitution, but it did not succeed.</p>

example of Milton and Cromwell. Of Milton, Toland says: “In
his early days, he was a favorer of those Protestants, then opprobriously
called by the name of Puritans. In his middle years, he was
best pleased with the Independents and Anabaptists, as allowing of
more liberty than others, and coming nearest, in his opinion, to the
primitive practice; but in the latter part of his life, he was not a
professed member of any particular sect among Christians; he frequented
none of their assemblies, nor made use of their peculiar rites
in his family.” Ivirney’s Life of Milton, p. 251.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f337'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r337'>337</a>. In a letter, dated May 8, 1682, he requests Governor Bradstreet,
of Boston, to assist him in printing some “discourses, which (by
many tedious journies) I have had with the <em>scattered English</em> at Narraganset,

<p class='c009'><a href='#r338'>338</a>. Mr. Williams says, that Mr. Eliot promised a suit of clothes to
an old Indian, who, not understanding him, asked another Indian,
what Mr. Eliot said. This reminds us of the well known anecdote
respecting his translation of the Bible:—While Eliot was engaged
in translating the Bible into the Indian language, he came to the following
passage in Judges, 5:28: “The mother of Sisera looked out
at the window, and cried through the <em>lattice</em>,” &amp;c. Not knowing an
Indian word to signify lattice, he applied to several of the natives,
and endeavored to describe to them what a lattice resembled. He
described it as frame work, netting, wicker, or whatever occurred to
him as illustrative, when they gave him a long, barbarous and unpronouncable
word, as are most of the words in their language.
Some years after, when he had learned their dialect more correctly,
he is said to have laughed outright, upon finding that the Indians had
given him the true term for <em>eel-pot</em>. “The mother of Sisera looked
out at the window, and cried through the <em>eel-pot</em>.” Bigelow’s History
of Natick, p. 84. This anecdote illustrates the difficulties of translating,
and may suggest a useful caution to translators.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r339'>339</a>. “February 19, 1665. Ordered, That Roger Williams shall have
his first choice, after William Hawkins and John Steere, of the fifty
acres of land on the east side of the north line, which beginneth
seven miles from Fox’s Hill, west.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“June 4, 1666. It is granted unto Roger Williams, that he may
change three acres of land lying in the neck, and take it up somewhere
about the third lake, if it may, with conveniency, without
damage to the highways, or other men’s lands, which are already laid
out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>September 30, 1667, he was allowed to change three acres of land,
which was laid out to him, in addition to his house lot, and take it
up in any part of the common which is not prohibited.</p>

<p class='c009'>May 2, 1667, there were laid out to him “fifty acres between the
seven mile and the four line.” This four mile line seems to have
been the original line, about four miles west from Fox’s Hill. Additional
land being purchased of the Indians, the seven mile line
was established, June 4, 1660, beginning seven miles west of Fox’s
Hill, and running north to Pawtucket river, and south to Pawtuxet
river.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f340'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r340'>340</a>. John Howland, Esq. says: “I think there must have been a
bridge at Weybosset before 1712.” Perhaps the bridge ordered to be
built over Moshassuck river, in 1662, and to which Mr. Williams’ letter
may refer, was intended to be somewhere between the present
Great Bridge and Smith’s Bridge, for the purpose of getting access
to the natural meadows at the head of the cove. The mention of
“hay time,” and the references of Mr. Williams to the “hopes of
meadow,” may strengthen this supposition. Mr. Howland says, “I
have frequently been told by Nathan Waterman, that teams and men
on horseback used to cross the river (before his day) across the clam
bed, opposite Angell’s land (at low tide) and land somewhere on the
western shore. The Thomas Olney lot was where the Knight Dexter
tavern now is, and Angell’s was the next south, including part of
the Baptist meeting-house lot, and Steeple street. In front of this,
lay the shoal place, called the clam-bed.” May 14, 1660, in a petition
of the town to the General Assembly, against an assessment on the
town of thirty pounds, to build a prison at Newport, the town said,
that they had just spent one hundred and sixty pounds in building a
bridge. April 27, 1663, George Sheppard gave all his lands west
of seven mile line to the town, for “maintaining a bridge at Weybosset.”</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r343'>343</a>. This remarkable man was born at Drayton, in Leicestershire, in
1624. He was placed as an apprentice to a grazier, but, at the age
of nineteen, he thought himself called to forsake every thing else,
and devote himself to religion. In 1648, he began to preach, and
adopted the peculiar language and manners which have distinguished
his followers. He incurred persecution, was often imprisoned,
and treated with great severity. In 1669, he married, and soon after
visited America, where he remained two years, and made many
proselytes. He returned to England, and after many sufferings, he
died in 1690, in the sixty-seventh year of his age. His works form
three folio volumes. “He was undoubtedly a man of strong natural
parts, and William Penn speaks in high terms of his meekness,
humility and temperance.”—Ency. Amer. art. George Fox.</p>

Governor Cranston. They were dated July 13, but Mr. Cranston
did not receive them till the 26th, which, as he said, excited his surprise.

should receive two shillings per day. A law was passed, exempting
from military duty persons who had conscientious scruples.
On September 2, 1673, it was enacted, that every person who sold
liquor, so that any one became drunk, or who kept a gaming house,
should be fined six shillings. Constables were appointed to watch
on the “first day of the week” against all “deboystness.” There
was, about this time, a trial of an Indian, by a jury, half of whom
were Indians. In 1679, a fine of five shillings was imposed for employing
an Indian or other servant on the first day; and the same
fine, or sitting in the stocks three hours, for gaming, playing, shooting,
or sitting drinking in an alehouse “more than necessity requireth,”
on the first day. It does not appear, that there was any
rule, by which to judge of the “necessity.” The doctrine of total
abstinence was then unknown.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 11th of March, 1674–5, Mr. Williams acknowledged the
receipt from Benjamin Hernden of six shillings, ninepence, making
up eleven pounds, “for the house and land sold to him, which was
John Clawson’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r374'>374</a>. The laws, in some of our States, which make clergymen ineligible
to certain civil offices, are unjust, and inconsistent with our republican
institutions. Every man has equal civil rights, and the exclusion
of any class of men from the enjoyment of any of those
rights, is an odious proscription. It is, indeed, desirable, that no
clergyman should accept a civil office, because his duties as a minister
of the Gospel ought to be sufficient to occupy his mind. But he
has a right, as a citizen, to be elected to any office; and to exclude
him is an assumption of the power to establish a national religion,
for if a man may be excluded from office, because he is a minister,
he may, by the same authority, be invested with office, because he
is a minister. It is remarkable, that those who clamor so loudly
against church and state, do not see any inconsistency in the exclusion
of clergymen, as such, from office.</p>

be made terrible engines of persecution, in the hands of ill-disposed

a soldier in the Low Countries, under Sir Thomas Fairfax, one of the first settlers of
Dorchester, Mass, in 1630. He afterwards removed to Windsor, Conn. He put an end
to the Pequod war, in 1638; was appointed, soon after, Major General of the Connecticut
forces, and in May, 1660, was elected Deputy Governor of that colony. He died at
Norwich, in the seventy-third year of his age, in 1672 or 1673. An account of the Pequod
war was published by him, republished in Hubbard’s Narrative, and by Rev. T.
Prince. In the fourth volume of the Massachusetts Historical Collections, a curious
poem is published, of Governor Wolcott’s, giving an account of his predecessor Winthrop’s
embassy to the Court of Charles II., to obtain a charter, in which Mason is mentioned
with the highest eulogies. Winthrop is made to give the King a relation, among
other things, of the Pequod war, and says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The army now drawn up: to be their head</div>

      <div class='line'>Without a special note of dignity.’)</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r393'>393</a>. The Scituate here mentioned, must be in Massachusetts, as there was no town of
that name in Rhode-Island till 1730.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f394'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r394'>394</a>. It has been alleged, with a view to lessen Mr. Williams’ claim to the honor of being
the chief agent in establishing liberty of conscience in Rhode-Island, that the preceding
charter contains no provision for the protection of religious liberty. But it may be replied,
that the instrument conveyed full power to establish any form of government, and
enact any laws, which the inhabitants might deem proper, provided that they were not
repugnant to the laws of England. The charter is in very general terms. It prescribes
no mode of civil government, and omits, of course, any reference to religious affairs.
The principles of Mr. Williams and his friends were well known to the gentlemen who
signed the charter. Mr. Williams could desire nothing more than entire liberty to the
inhabitants to regulate the civil and ecclesiastical concerns of the colony according to
their own pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f395'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r395'>395</a>. “Mr. Williams sold from his estate a lot, forty-eight feet wide on the street, to Mr.
Gabriel Bernon, a very respectable French gentleman, of great property, and sincere
religion, who came from Rochelle, France, where he had suffered much, and had been
imprisoned two years, on account of his religion, which led Mr. Williams greatly to
esteem and respect him. He was born at Rochelle, April 6, 1644; lived ten years
at Newport and Narraganset, and died in Providence, February 1, 1736, in the ninety-second
year of his age. He had ten children by his first wife, eight of whom, with
herself, came with him to this State. He had four children by his second wife, Mary
Harris. He was buried under the old Episcopal church, and was the ancestor of
many respectable families, in various parts of the State, in which are great numbers
of his posterity, connected with the names of Coddington, Helme, Whipple, Crawford,
Jenckes, Allen, Tourtellot, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The lot thus sold to Mr. Bernon contained the famous spring where Mr. Williams
landed, when he came to Providence in a canoe, with Thomas Angell, in 1636. Governor
Hutchinson says: “The inhabitants have a veneration for a spring, which runs
from the hill into the river, above the great bridge. The sight of this spring caused
him to stop his canoe, and land there.” Mass. His. vol. ii, p. 41.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the same lot where Mr. Nehemiah Dodge is now building a large brick
house, near the stone Episcopal church, a few feet eastward of the spring, of which
there is now no appearance, otherwise than at the bottom of his well, of a considerable
depth, from which it finds a covered outlet to the river; an instance, among
a thousand others, of the great alteration in the town, since its first settlement.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f396'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r396'>396</a>. These towns were, in the order of their settlement or incorporation: Providence,
1636; Portsmouth, 1637–8; Newport, 1638–9; Warwick, 1642–3; Westerly, 1665;
New Shoreham, 1672; East-Greenwich, 1677; Jamestown, 1678; North-Kingstown, and
South-Kingstown, 1722; Smithfield, Glocester, and Scituate, 1730; Charlestown, 1738.
In 1730, the whole number of inhabitants in the colony, was 17,935. The towns of
Burrillville, Cranston, Cumberland, Foster, Johnston, North-Providence, Little-Compton,
Middletown, Tiverton, Coventry, West-Greenwich, Exeter, Hopkinton, Richmond,
Barrington, Bristol, and Warren, have been since added, making the total number of
towns thirty-one. Population, in 1830, 97,212.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f397'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r397'>397</a>. This list shows how unjustly some persons, who have chosen to vilify Rhode-Island,
have made the Baptists responsible for every thing which was done, or neglected. The
Baptists have always, perhaps, been more numerous than any other denomination, but they
have been a minority of the whole community. In 1738, it seems, they had but nine, out
of thirty religious societies or churches.</p>

    <div>FULLER’S WORKS, COMPLETE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>LINCOLN, EDMANDS &amp; CO. have recently published this
valuable work, in two large octavo volumes, on a fair burgeois type
and fine paper, at the very reasonable price of 6 dollars. The cost
of the former edition (14 dollars) precluded many students from
replenishing their libraries; and they are now gratified in being able
to possess a work so replete with <em>doctrinal</em> arguments and <em>practical</em>
religion. No Christian can read Fuller without having his impulses
to action quickened—and every student ought to <em>study</em> him, if he
wishes to arm himself against the attempts of every enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since this edition has been issued, several periodicals have noticed
it with full commendation. We have recently given extracts from
notices in the Boston Recorder, Christian Watchman, &amp;c.—and we
now make a few extracts from an able review of the work, which
appeared in the October number of the American Baptist Magazine.
It was written by the President of a College, at the South, and is
admired for its elegant and just view of the sentiments of this great
author.</p>

<p class='c009'>He says:—“This work, in the material and style of execution, is
highly creditable to the American press. The publishers, in issuing
this work, have conferred an obligation upon community, and will,
doubtless, be rewarded in a liberal return of their investment. Mr.
Fuller was among the few extraordinary men who have ever appeared
in this world. He possessed great vigor of intellect, an uncommon
share of good sense, inflexible integrity, and the most ardent
love for truth. All his powers, therefore, were early consecrated
to the service of the church. His mind was turned, even before he
entered the ministry, to the study of those great truths, which involve
the highest honor of God, and the dearest interests of man.
These truths he embraced with all the affections of his heart, and
maintained with wonderful acuteness, and by invincible arguments;
for they were indeed the sheet-anchor of his soul. He possessed
very clear and consistent views of human depravity, and of
the grounds of moral obligation. To gain them, however, he had
to endure heavy trials and severe studies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The grand design of Mr. Fuller, as a writer, was to produce moral
action. He believed in the divine purpose, that the rest of heaven
shall be gained through constant vigilance and labor. In this way
the Christian character is to be formed, and the soul fitted for future
blessedness. But notwithstanding the necessity of this painful care
and effort, man is much inclined to be heedless and slothful; and
this proneness has been strengthened by ingenious and plausible
theories in religion. Of this truth Mr. Fuller had abundant evidence.
In his life and travels, he witnessed the hyper-calvinistic,
or antinomian spirit, sweeping over the churches, withering up, like
the Sirocco’s blast, their vital principle, and converting them into
barren wastes. Nor was the influence of this spirit confined to professors.
Its legitimate tendency is, to keep both saints and sinners
in a state of inaction. For it exalts the former above obligation,
and sinks the latter below it. This spirit he knew had its origin in
the false notion, that human apostacy releases sinners from the
duties of piety, and that the gospel dispensation is designed to
render the law useless, and to excuse the people of God from complying
with its requirements. Over these things Mr. Fuller prayed
and wept. And when he took up his pen, it was his chief purpose
to correct these errors, and thus to rouse the church from their paralyzing
influence. In accomplishing his object, he resorted to no
unwarranted expedients. He believed that God had provided adequate
agents to sway the soul, and that these are principally three:
truth, motive, and the influences of the Divine Spirit. Truth convinces
the understanding, motive affects the heart, and the Spirit
overcomes the will. The great cause, he believed, why the means
of salvation have produced so little effect, is—that their power has
been greatly weakened by human devices. Truth has been eclipsed,
conscience stupified, and the heart allured by unscriptural motives.
The constant aim, therefore, of this eminent man, was to
disperse the darkness, in which truth was involved, that it might
shine forth in all its heavenly lustre. He labored to remove from
the divine law the deadening swathe with which it had been bound,
by those who feared its edge, that it might act with unobstructed
force. It has been said of the immortal Butler, that he has done
more than any other man to restore to conscience her sovereign
sway in the human soul. So we may say, that Fuller has, probably,
done more than any other divine, to restore to the law of God, or
to gospel truth, its sacred dominion in the economy of grace. Truth
and the voice of conscience are the two great ruling powers in the
moral world. Hence the well-being of society requires, that they
should be constantly kept in the clearest light. And that man, who
is the instrument, in giving these chief elements of power the freest
action upon the human mind, renders the most important service to
his fellow-men.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is another light in which we are anxious the publications
of Mr. Fuller should be viewed—in their adaptedness to prevent
two evils, to which the Christian world at the present day are peculiarly
exposed. These are, first, losing sight of that mysterious and
divine agency, on which the success of all their efforts must depend.
And, second, failing to keep in full view those cardinal truths of
the gospel, by which they must gain and support all their victories
in the empire of darkness. In every period the church has been
inclined to forget her dependence on divine influences; but, perhaps,
never so much so, as in the present.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Though for thirty years we have been conversant with the
writings of Mr. Fuller, yet we must say, that this revision of them
has greatly heightened them in our estimation. And viewing them
in the light we do, we cannot but indulge the belief, that they will,
for ages yet to come, continue to enlighten and bless the church of
Christ.”</p>

<p class='c016'>This edition was printed from a London edition, just revised, by Mr. A. G. Fuller,
who says, in his preface, “In presenting to the public what has long been called for,
viz. a complete edition of the works of my revered father, it is unnecessary to offer any
remarks on the character of the writings, most of which have for many years been before
the public, and must now be supposed to stand on their own merits. It may, however,
be proper to state, that the present edition not only contains a great number of valuable
pieces which had been before unavoidably omitted, but also a portion of original manuscript,
part of which is woven into the memoir, and part inserted in the last volume.”</p>
